Mae Ploy makes both of these tasks quite easy to accomplish. The very best curry is made from making one's own paste, however finding the time and perhaps even more difficult, the ingredients to do so does not compensate for the difference in taste. In my experience, Mae Ploy is an excellent green curry paste that tastes plenty fresh and will give you that same satisfaction that you get from a Thai restaurant.A few things I've learned using their curry pastes over the years:1) If you are cooking for people who are not used to Thai food, the proportions indicated in the directions on the container will be WAY TOO HOT for them. This is especially true with Green Curry and even more important if there will be children eating the meal. It's very easy to adjust the amount of paste used, and with practice you'll learn just how much is good for the experienced palate and how much is good for kids or newbies.2) The packaging doesn't mention anything about how long the product keeps. The paste comes in a plastic container with a lid that can seal, but it's actually in a thick plastic bag inside that container. I used to cut open the bag and leave it in the container, but I've taken to just cutting a hole in the corner and using it like an icer would in a bakery. I feel like the double container might help it to keep a bit longer. Once the bag is opened, the product should be stored in the refrigerator. There is enough in the container to make several curry dishes.3) Mae Ploy paste is fantastic, but choosing a bad coconut milk can degrade the quality of your dish or even ruin it altogether. Don't go with \"lite\" brands, and look for something more authentic if you can find it. I've found Chaokoh brand comes with a higher amount of cream which gives your curry a more consistent flavor. Chaokoh is the brand most often found in Asian markets and I've always figured that they would know best.This product is incredibly easy to use and turns out a Green Curry that will make your friends think yours is good as a restaurant's. I don't believe there is a better paste on the market and when you factor in the price it's a no brainer. (FYI,If you live in an area where there are asian markets, you will do better buying it there as it will be even cheaper).","overall":5,"summary":"Authentic, easy, and delicious!","unixReviewTime":1383609600,"reviewTime":"11 5, 2013"}

I enjoyed the flavor and it managed to fill me up in place of a regular breakfast.  I didn't get hungry until at least three hours later (and for me that is actually pretty good, I'm always hungry).The main flavor of this bar was the peanut butter. The chocolate barely made an appearance and that was just fine for me.  It was just a surprise here and there when you hit a chip.  The bar was chewy, but not really crunchy from the oats and other grains and fibers that were included in the bar.  It was sweet, and that's to be expected from the sweeteners of brown rice syrup, honey, evaporated can juice syrup and the chocolate chips.  Lots of sweeteners in here making the bar content of sugar 18 grams.  So that is something to watch.The rest of the ingredients were good.  There's whole oats, rice flour, and other pronounceable ingredients throughout.  And a whole list of minerals and vitamins is included so it's even somewhat nutritional for you.  But there are a lot of allergens here as well, as is obvious by the peanut butter flavor.  And another thing of note is that this bar packs a walloping 240 calories.  So use it as a meal replacement or for during vigorous exercise as opposed to a snack.  It would definitely be a good bar for a hiking trip.I liked it and will probably consider it again for breakfast.  It kept me full and I liked the taste, and it will have inspired me to try other PowerBar flavors as well.Review by M.

I was just getting started on grinding my own coffee and I read somewhere that this was the way to make the best coffee. I was very satisfied and it lasted for years and years. Then I met my wife. She took one look at my coffee-making operation and shook her head in disbelief. I needed a high-end coffeemaker. This just wouldn't do! Well, I ended up buying a Cuisineart Coffeemaker with all kinds of bells and whistles. It was good equipment and made a good cup of coffee, although the cost of the equipment was over 7 times that of my Melitta and the coffee wasn't as good. Plus, the equipment had to be meticulously cleaned and that quickly turned into an onerous task. My old Melitta was relegated to camping duties and finally lost.Well, my wife is now gone. And I was about to clean the Cuisineart Coffeemaker for the umpteenth time. I came up with the brilliant idea of going back to a Melitta. Good move! They were still around. I couldn't spot them in stores, but they were available on Amazon. What a neat gadget! I used it this morning and the coffee tasted so good! And it was so simple! And it took no longer than my super-duper coffeemaker. What a relief to be back to a simpler life. Well, I cleaned my Cuisineart Coffeemaker and stored it away. If I have guests, I can always break it out just to show them how I'm living the good life. Now, remember all that nasty business about cleaning that Cuisineart?

The set includes the cone filter, the carafe, a lid and 5 paper filters- everything you need to try it out. I considered getting the larger one, but another reviewer noted that the coffee does not stay warm long and figured we would be better off with a size we could drink quickly.  While I was looking for a non-plastic cone, this is BPA free. The carafe is made in Germany, the cone top is made in Canada.Now to the coffee... It is fantastic!  I use the espresso grind that DH uses in the Bunn.  The coffee is just as strong without the bitterness. It doesn't seem to take any more time. I use the Hario kettle on our induction stove so boiling water takes no time. Then, the pour over is almost zen like. I mainly use this on my late mornings and on weekends.

I find the system more convenient than coffee machines.> If the power goes off, you can still make coffee if you have a gas stove or a camp stove.> It is easy to brew  exactly the amount of coffee you want, and exactly the strength that you want---including adjusting to new roast and grinds. You can even mix caffeinated and decaffeinated coffees if you wish.> In a way, the Mellita system is more \"sanitary\". It is easy to forget a used filter in a coffee maker, maybe for weeks if you go on a vacation, and find a fungus garden in there. You can't ignore a used Melitta filter, because it is out in the open. If you forget a used Melitta filter, it and the coffee grinds just dry out.  It is also much easier to wash the Melitta components---just a quick rinse under the tap is usually good enough.  Caveat--some types of coffee are oiler than others---you may need to actually wash your cone and carafe if a quick rinse is not sufficient.SIZE OPTIONSThe carafes for which the \"6 cup\" and \"10 cup\" systems can nominally hold 6 or 10 cups off coffee (filled to the brim), but that is really irrelevant.  A more important consideration is cups vs mugs.  How many people still drink \"cups\" of coffee?  So, it is the \"mug-capacity\" (1 mug = 1 1\/2 cups) of the filters and cones which really counts.#2 filters\/conesRecomemnded: 1 cupPractical Maximum: 1 mugTheoretical Maximum: 2 cups#4 filters\/cones (\"6 cup system\")Recommended: 1-2 mugsPractical Maximum:  2 1\/2 mugsTheoretical Maximum: 4 mugs#6 filters\/cones (\"10 cup system\")Recommended: 2-3 mugsPractical Maximum: 4 mugsTheoretical Maximum: 6 mugsHowever, I don't follow my own recommendation:  In the morning, I want coffee \"now!\"  I often run out of patience trying to brew even 1 mug of coffee using #4 filter\/cones.  On the other hand, the #6 filter\/cones holds a whole mug of hot water in one quick pour, and drains about as fast as you can continue to pour the water in---so I find it very convenient for brewing 1 to 2 mugs of coffee at a time, and on rare occasions to easily brew 4 mugs (6 cups) of coffee.  However, in this case, the hot water has little time to extract the flavor from the coffee.  To compensate, I grind my coffee very finely.  I could simply use more coffee, but that would be wasteful.The #6 filters\/cones (\"10-cup system\") is faster and more flexible, at a slightly higher cost for the filters.Melitta Cone Filter Coffeemaker 10 Cup, 1-CountIf you are patient and your space is very limited, such as in a camper, boat, or in a college dorm, or if you really want only 1 or 2 mugs of coffee at a time, #4 filter\/cones (the so-called \"6 cup system\") is a good choice.GRINDS OF COFFEEIf you usually brew the \"recommended\" or fewer number of mugs of coffee, then very-finely ground coffee is recommended. If you usually brew the the \"recommended\" or more number of mugs at a time, then a medium grind coffee may work best.  Most supermarket \"fine grind\" is actually a medium grind.  If you brew more than the \"practical maximum\" a medium-coarse grind will work better.  If you grind your own coffee in an electric grinder, \"coarse\" is only a second or two, medium-fine is perhaps 10 seconds, and very fine is perhaps 30 seconds, until the pitch of the sound changes, indicating that no more grinding is taking place.REUSEIf you use very-fine grind, then discard the used filter when finished (because most of the flavor will be extracted, and the filter will be clogged up by the fine grinds).  If you use a medium grind, then you can optionally reuse the grinds in the afternoon to make a second batch of coffee (which will be lower in caffeine).  Coffee-freaks may object to reusing grinds, but it works just fine.FORMULARegardless of the grind, you have to use the same formula for the TOTAL amount of coffee actually made, i.e., 1 to 2 tablespoons of ground coffee per mug, depending on your taste, brand, etc.FILTERSPresumably, brown filters are easier on the environment---and on you, less chemicals having been used to manufacture them.  Unfortunately, #6 filters are hard to find in most grocery stores, but easy to purchase via Amazon.Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 6, 40-Count Filters (Pack of 12)Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100-Count Filters (Pack of 6)Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, White, No. 6, 40-Count Filters (Pack of 12)In an emergency, you can use #4 filters in a #6 cone, but you'll regret it (having been spoiled by the convenience of #6 filters).RECOMMENDATIONS ON MAKING GOOD COFFEE>>Use fresh unchlorinated water if possible.  Do not use \"softened\", \"sparkling\", or \"mineral\" water.  If you let an open pitcher of water sit on a counter for a few hours (or overnight), most of the chlorine will evaporate.  The best way to get pure water is a reverse-osmosis system.  Bring the water to a quick boil, but don't leave it boiling too long--that will flush out the dissolved oxygen, leaving the coffee tasting flat.>>There is a huge difference between brands and roasts.  Experiment and enjoy.  However, even more important is freshness---which is the greatest challenge.  How can you know if the coffee is fresh?  The easiest way is to signup with a service such as Gavelia, Boca Java, or Coffee Bean Direct--whose only business is providing you with freshly roasted (and freshly-ground if you wish) coffee.>>Particularly if you do not use a \"coffee service\", its best to buy whole beans and grind them just before brewing.  A $15 grinderKrups 203-42 Fast Touch Coffee Grinder, Blackis as good as a $200 grinder. It takes only a few seconds to grind a batch of coffee while waiting for the water to boil.>>For newbies, \"French\" or \"dark roast\" coffee is rich and bitter, and usually brewed \"strong\".  Light roasts are more complex, but some are acidic, and are usually brewed and drank more like tea.  Light roast Indonesian coffee is particularly complex.  Caveat, \"complex\" does not necessarily mean flavorful---some dark roasts are wonderful, but it is probably harder to find a good dark roast.  TheCoffee Bean Direct Assorted Whole Bean Coffee Sampler, 9-Pound Boxavailable from Amazon is a good way to explore the varieties of coffee.>>The filter cone and carafe should be rinsed off after every use, otherwise your coffee can be contaminated with stale oils. A weekly wash in the dishwasher won't hurt.>>Elsewhere, you'll read endless nonsense about the exact water temperature, how fast or how slow to pour the water, the value of porcelain vs plastic cones, preheating the cones with hot water, how finely ground the coffee should be, etc.  It's all nonsense (except possibly to engineers who design coffeemakers). 99% of what matters is the quality of the ingredients: water and coffee.  You want fresh oxygenated chlorine-free salt-free water, and good quality recently-roasted and recently-ground coffee.SAFETYIt is easy to forget the glass carafe on a hot stove.  I broke at least 6 carafes before I purchased a whistling teakettle.Revere 2-1\/3-Quart Whistling Tea KettleNEVER use the carafe to boil water or reheat coffee.  The flood of water might crack a ceramic stovetop, or put out a the flame of a gas stove---both causing catastrophic problems.  Use your microwave to reheat (1 mug of coffee = 30-45 seconds); it's faster and safer.It is important to take care to pour the boiling water into the filter, not between the filter and the filter cone. It is any easy accident to make. To minimize such accidents, fold over the \"joined\" edges of the filters so that the filter opens wider. If you are a particular klutz, a quick rinse with a little cold water before you add the ground coffee can \"glue\" the filter to the cone.SUGAR IN YOUR COFFEE?Purist insist that coffee should always be drank black.  While I tentatively agree, I can't.  My taste-buds are overly sensitive to bitterness.  However, I have found that pure SteviaPure Stevia Extract Powder by Kal - 3.5 ozis a good replacement for sugar for me.  Oddly, it isn't as sweet as sugar, but is just as effective in cutting the bitterness, which is what I really need.  Truvia and other brands in packets or described as \"spoonable\" contain bulking agents which effect the flavor and leave a yucky residue, and are comparatively expensive.  KAL Pure Stevia contains no bulking agents and is very economical.SALT IN YOUR COFFEE?It's a naval tradition.  I've found that a few grains of sea-salt in a cup of light-roast coffee can be pleasant, but not so compelling that I make a habit of it.  However, a little salt is more noticeable (in a good way) in ice coffee.MILK IN YOUR COFFEE?If the purpose is just to cut the acidity, then you need to try a different coffee or brewing method.  If the purpose is to cut the bitterness, you might want to try stevia instead.  If you simply like milk in your coffee---I say, indulge yourself with a little real (not fake) half-and-half, or even heavy cream.  I usually drink my coffee black with a little stevia, but for a rare desert cup, real sugar and real cream are essential.GENERAL SHOPPING RECOMMENDATIONAfter major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your receipt, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.","overall":5,"summary":"Does the job","unixReviewTime":1307404800,"reviewTime":"06 7, 2011"}

We have gone through countless steam espresso machines over the years and spent many a Saturday (yes, the whole day) soaking the espresso machine in descaling solution and then cleaning the descaling solution out of the espresso machine so the first cup in the morning, wouldn't taste like descaling solution.Well, we can no longer find.....anywhere, basic steam espresso machines as all we can find are fancy espresso machines that will quickly clog up with scale or drip coffee makers that churn out weak, watery coffee shop style coffee.....\"More coffee hun?\"  Do you really want to know?Enters this drip carafe as I tried making drip coffee out of a paper towel and a strainer and found the coffee to be acceptable but still a bit bitter and not up to par.  I ordered up this carafe with six hundred #4 filters at less than one-third the cost of what a replacement steam espresso coffee maker would have cost, based upon the last purchase price of eighty dollars US.Yes, it's a bit of a \"BIG\" pain to make a carafe of coffee.  The water needs to be heated in a microwave, two cups at a time for four minutes and then slowly drizzled over the fresh grinds until all the water has been allowed to drain through the filter.  This needs to be done twice, using three heaping teaspoons of fresh ground, French Roast, coffee beans, in each of two filter baskets.The good, now that's what I'm talking about!  The resulting coffee is fresh, thick, robust, smooth, full flavor, that's what I'm talking about, coffee.  The point, if you care about your coffee and how it tastes, for the effort, this is for you.  We drink our coffee black and do not find need to add creams, sugars or otherwise to make it palpable as we like our coffee in the morning, just as it is, perfectly black.An aside, we buy filters, six hundred filters at a time.  We use three to four filters each morning as we brew up coffee at the rate of sixteen ounces per three heaping teaspoons of fresh ground coffee, per filter.  Doing the math, this is about a six month supply of coffee filters.If you're looking for convenience, dash and go, this is not for you.  If you're looking to have fresh, smooth, robust coffee in the morning and don't mind the hassle it takes to get what you want, this package is definitely for you.---------------------Addendum:I like this combination so much that today, 10Aug13, I purchased a second pot\/filter cone combination.  FYI, the coffee is the best morning coffee we've had.  We are very happy with the coffee this hand pour drip system makes.  It's a bit slow working with a single filter cone so in a few days, we'll have a second pot\/filter cone to speed the morning coffee making process up.  Yes, more cleaning after making coffee but definitely worth the extra effort.","overall":5,"summary":"I love it.","unixReviewTime":1373500800,"reviewTime":"07 11, 2013"}

I do not understand this. I live forty miles from New York City, hardly a wilderness area. However, I was happy to find the filters on Amazon. By combining the filters with another order, I was able to get free shipping.Is brown better than white? Many people believe that since the brown filters require less processing than the white filters, i.e., white filters are bleached, the brown filters are better environmentally. I will go with that. My experience has been that the brown filters tend to break through more often than the white ones.

I find the system more convenient than coffee machines.If the power goes off, you can still make coffee if you have a gas stove or a camp stove.It is easy to brew exactly the amount of coffee you want, and exactly the strength that you want---including adjusting to new roast and grinds.  You can even mix caffeinated and decaffeinated coffees if you wish.  I often re-use the morning's grinds in the afternoon, by adding a spoon of decaffeinated coffee.  That is not recommended with an automatic coffee machine---because if you clog up the filter, the boiling water could overflow.  No problem clogging up a Melitta filter, if it drains slowly, then pour slowly.In a way, the Mellita system is more \"sanitary\".  It is easy to forget a used filter in a coffee maker, maybe for weeks if you go on a vacation, and find a fungus garden in there.  You can't ignore a used Melitta filter, because it is out in the open.  If you forget a used Melitta filter, it and the coffee grinds just dry out.Although most people use smaller Mellita filters and cones, I prefer the large #6 system.  The #6 system (filters, cone, and caraf) is intended for brewing 4-8 cups at a time.  However, the larger filter holds more water, and it drains faster, so you can brew 2 cups of coffee with a #6 filter faster than with a #4 filter.  So the #6 system is faster and more flexible, at a very slightly higher cost for the filters.If you grind your own coffee, the water (for 1-2 cups) is almost boiling by the time you've set up the filter, ground the coffee, and put away the coffee grinder.  A #6 filter actually holds the water for about 2 cups of coffee, but drains so fast that pouring 4-8 cups of water through just takes perhaps 10--15 seconds.  The corresponding #6 glass carafe is marked for up to 8 cups, but obviously it takes longer to boil the water for 8 or so cups of coffee.It's as simple as it gets, the price of the filters is cheap, and the quality of the results as terrific.  What else could you want?Presumably, brown filters are easier on the environment---and on you, less chemicals having been used to manufacture them.The specific Amazon product is probably the cheapest way to purchase the preferred filters.NOTEIt is important to take care to pour the boiling water into the filter, not between the filter and the filter cone.  It is any easy accident  to make.  To minimize such accidents, fold over the \"joined\" edges of the filters so that the filter opens wider.  If you are a particular klutz, a quick rinse with a little cold water before you add the coffee can \"glue\" the filter to the cone.Recommendation:  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your receipt, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon.  When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid.  Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.","overall":5,"summary":"The Mellita Coffee System","unixReviewTime":1262822400,"reviewTime":"01 7, 2010"}

By the time I was thirteen I was decorating cakes myself.  Paste food colors, which allow for very intense color without using a lot of product, have had a home in my kitchen for more than 50 years.  Often they have been Wilton colors. In years past when I was doing lots of cake decorating I usually bought 1 ounce or even 4 ounce jars of color, but even a 1 ounce jar is far more than you need for the limited use of home baking.The half-ounce jars inWilton 601-5580 1\/2-Ounce Certified-Kosher Icing Colors, Set of 12offer enough color to easily last a year or more, even allowing for dyeing your Easter eggs.  Do remember that a tiny bit of this goes a very, very long way and that it will stain your hands & counter.  I find it best to remove only a small part of the inner seal and then use a toothpick to remove just the tiniest bit of color at a time.  (You can always add more for deeper color.)A couple of notes - Frosting colored with paste color deepens in color as it stands.  You won't notice this much with pastel colors but it is readily apparent with bright red, blue and green.  Roses the exact red of red roses when you make them will dry a very deep maroon. Also, very deep colors that require a substantial amount of color to achieve usually will have an \"off\" taste from so much color.How to Dye Eggs with Paste Color -This will give you true red, purple, bright blue and other brilliantly hued eggs.Put about 1\/3-1\/2 teaspoon of paste color in the bottom of a cup or mug.  (I like to use cups with light colored interiors.)  Add 1 teaspoon of white or cider vinegar, then fill the cup to about 1.5 inches from the top with boiling water.  Stir to dissolve.  Soak hard boiled eggs in the color solution until you get the shade you want.

I love the way the spicy heat builds and spreads, and the subtle and not-so-subtle flavors that you can taste. Also, it is salty enough to use as a substitute for salt the same way you would with soy sauce or a fish sauce.A little goes a long way, and especially if you are counting calories, fat or sodium intake. A serving is about a teaspoon - more than enough to mix into rice or drizzle over other dishes - and it comes in at 90 calories. That same serving contains 9 grams of fat and 440mg of sodium. So, do use sparingly if you are watching any of those nutritional factors.Another thing that I personally love is this is unfiltered. There are pieces of peppers and other ingredients that will suspend in the oil if you vigorously shake the jar before serving. Those add a lot to the flavor profile, which is predominately salty and piquant (and there is also a distinct element of umami).If you love spicy sauces and oils and want to 'spice' up your meal (pun intended) this is an excellent infused oil that will do the trick. I wish I could elaborate on how it works for sir frying, but I do not use it that way.

I was very optimistic because I normally love everything Tazo offers, but this time I had my hopes dashed.I brewed up a mug of this tea and was immediately alarmed at the bouquet. The teabag smelled different, but once the hot water hit it the smell seemed to really magnify. But I scooped in a few teaspoons of sugar and hoped for the best. I managed to choke down about a third of the cup before I called it a day. Life is too short to drink something you don't like.However, I had read a review that mentioned how good and palatable this tea was when combined with the Tazo Lotus. I figured it was worth a shot, otherwise I'd have to throw out this tea altogether.The Lotus smelled great, so I was excited. I blended the two bags (one Lotus and one Wild Sweet Orange) in a large mug, then removed the Wild Sweet Orange after a minute. I left the Lotus in for another minute or two (yeah, definitely two).The result was a very unusual, but not unappealing, beverage. Would I drink this more than once a day? No. Was it very interesting and something that I'll try again? Yes.Live and learn, I guess.","overall":2,"summary":"Not for everyone, especially me.","unixReviewTime":1168732800,"reviewTime":"01 14, 2007"}

It contains lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. It is not sweet, very fruity, and not subtle at all, a wonderful tea if you enjoy orangey teas.Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, \"The Reincarnation of Tea\". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some \"natural flavors\" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, \"a lively blend of sweet citrus herbs and orange essences. Sweet, yet tart, this is a cup of liquid sunshine, radiating multi-layered orange flavors with exotic hints of spice and a distinctive floral finish. Wild, indeed.\" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Wild Sweet Orange as \"tart, sweet, smooth, licorice\". Tazo describes the aroma as \"oranges, roses, lime\".  This is pretty accurate, although the words give hope that the taste of the tea never quite approaches.I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Wild Sweet Orange gets only four stars.****","overall":4,"summary":"Basic Orange Herb Tea","unixReviewTime":1158192000,"reviewTime":"09 14, 2006"}

The heated tea is nicely turned immediately, boldly, vividly, orange in color.  I don't need to add much sweetener even as it's tart but its tartness gives it more taste.The only drawbacks are its high price (compared to other teas which is why I'm always waiting for a sale on them) and having to wait to heat the water and waiting to cool it down in the refrigerator (or quickly in the freezer).  It's true as another reviewer said that it's very strong in taste after just leaving it in hot water for a few seconds so the longer you leave it in, the stronger and bitter or more tart it becomes and you could really be frugal and only need a tea bag for a half gallon to a gallon of water.  Adding ice helps dilute the taste as well as cool the tea down fast and cold, but I like my iced tea strong so i can taste its full flavor, so I try never to add ice.It's a delight as an everyday iced tea as well as a great gift for a friend.","overall":5,"summary":"Tangy orange fragrant tasty wonderful iced tea!!","unixReviewTime":1320364800,"reviewTime":"11 4, 2011"}

I found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality.I tried each tea separately and finally blended them together. Tazo Lotus and Tazo Wild Sweet Orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer.The way I make this tea is by steeping two Lotus and two Wild Sweet Orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. I make this in my coffee maker so there is plenty of time for the flavors to seep out into the steaming water. Then, you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea.Drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. Lotus Decaffeinated Green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Wild Sweet Orange is a blend of lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root.I love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents. The boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful.A romantic tea with a golden-orange color. I can never decide if I like this best hot or cold, so I end up drinking it hot and cold. Half on ice and half in a mug. When this tea is hot, it is much more romantic and aromatic. When chilled it takes on a more bitter component.For something even more exotic, try the Tazo Green Ginger tea.

It's a bit similar to Earl Grey but without that resinous aftertaste and more of a vanilla undertone. Just in the canister, the tea smells perfumed and perhaps overly-flavored, but brewed, the taste of the tea itself becomes more prominent, making a dark, rich, full-bodied brew with an enchantingly subtle flavor profile. It takes a bit of milk handily without turning weak and watery, and re-brews nicely (though re-brews don't take milk as well). It chills well; I prefer it plain when it's cold.

If you think Tabasco is hot, read no further as this sauce is not for you.I vaguely recall the first time I tasted this sauce, putting the end of a toothpick in the thick dark concoction and dabbing it onto my tongue and experiencing a very unpleasant feeling.  That was then.  Now I can easily put a generous drop on each bite of my sandwich or pizza, even with my morning eggs sometimes.  Yes, I am addicted to hot sauce and I will say that I have tried hundreds of different kinds.  This one, in my opinion, is the most flavorful while still delivering a good slap of heat.I know there are some die-hard Blair fans out there.  I will try and compare the two in as simple a way as I can.  While I prefer Dave's for the reasons mentioned above, I do acknowledge that Blair has managed to get much \"hotter\" mixtures and have a more of a \"gen-x\" or \"bad ass\" marketing campaign.  They will offer you insanely hot sauces, that aren't really sauces because they're simply pure extract.  Anyone can make extract that'll make your rectum erupt, but to make a sauce that is actually flavorful is the kicker.  The closest sauce to Dave's Insanity would probably be After Death.  The spice level is pretty similar, but Blair's has a grainy, almost sandy texture to it that kind of eats away at your palette.  My experience with Dave's has been the opposite, as it is smooth and has a nice texture to it.It all really comes down to preference, but as long as you have a good heat tolerance, this one delivers that and great flavor too.","overall":5,"summary":"Delicious.","unixReviewTime":1362441600,"reviewTime":"03 5, 2013"}

It's one of those sauces that you can put a little on a toothpick and watch someone's face light up as the heat arrives.  So when I saw that Dave's had a Ghost Pepper based sauce I was excited to see just what it was going to bring to the table.  The answer is pure smokey heat.The first time I tried it I was very sparing with it, putting just a couple of drops on a few slices of pizza and spreading them out.  The result was that I could taste the heat but not really the flavor of the sauce.  The next time I decided to just sprinkle 8 to 10 drops of the sauce over a few slices and I got the full throttled effect.  The sauce is hot, make no mistake about that.  It starts out hot and continues to linger, allowing each additional bite to add to the burn.  A nice greasy, cheesy pizza is the perfect delivery method as the fats in the cheese try to keep your tongue from burning up, but to no avail as it is just temporary relief.  I found each bite to get hotter and the sweat started to pour.  The amazing thing to me was that even with the heat level I was still enjoying the taste of the pizza and the sauce.The bottom line is if you like hot sauce HOT, this is good stuff.  Nice and hot with a delicious smokey flavor that I really enjoyed.  It may be the heat of legends, but if you use it wisely you'll get the burn and suffer no ill effects afterwards.

I only recently bought a \"hottest sauce\" while at a kind of flea market in England. It was also a ghost pepper sauce and i was shocked at the intensity of the burn. At first I was sort of proud of myself for being able to use it, but it did grow on me and I started using it as an actual condiment.  After the bottle ran out I thought I would see what was on Amazon and this sauce was ranked very highly so I bought it. So I really only have one other sauce to compare this to but here goes:The sauce is very hot. Almost too hot. It has a pasty consistency, almost exactly like tomato paste. Very finely ground. It has a more gummy consistency to it, like theres something added to it to give it a smoother texture though there's no such actual ingredient.What there is, however, as someone else pointed out, is pepper extract. It's the second listed ingredient so there must be a considerable amount. Perhaps it's what's giving this sauce that slimy texture I was eluding to earlier. This Pepper Extract doesn't state what KIND of pepper, and as it's an extract I imagine it must have gone through quite the extraction process.So what I'm getting at is this: the sauce feels more like a pepper extract, something which you should add small amounts of to large dishes for adding pure spice to the food. But it's missing the taste and feel of an actual hot sauce. There's little flavor, just a lot of burn. And I have to say that that's a big shame because the bhut jolokia pepper is very tasty. Almost fruity if I remember correctly.So I give this hot sauce 4 stars for the Effort and the level of spice, but I won't give it 5 stars because I think that goes to the generic bhut jolokia ghost pepper sauces with all the scary names and pictures on the bottle. The one I had was Fear Hot Sauce with a scary ghost woman on it, and it was much more like salsa, with little ground up pieces of ghost peppers and seeds in it and equal to, if not more burn than this one.If I change my mind as I go through this bottle, I'll update or comment on here again.","overall":4,"summary":"Kick to it","unixReviewTime":1320278400,"reviewTime":"11 3, 2011"}

Now it is the Naga Jolokia (also known as the Naga Morris, Nai Miris, Bih Jolokia and Bhut Jolokia, etc.) with a whopping 1,001,304  Scoville Heat Units according to the New Mexico State University Chile Pepper Institute. In February 2007, Guinness World Records certified the Bhut Jolokia (aka Naga Jolokia) as the hottest pepper in the world.  It is reportedly called the \"Ghost Pepper\" because after one bite of the pepper you \"give up the ghost\".Now Dave's Gourmet has made a sauce from this serious pepper.  This is nothing to fool around with, it will cause pain, a lot of pain.  So why would anybody want a sauce that hot (other than for bravado)?  I for one like the taste.  It is a little smokier that Habanero.  I also use it in sauces where I want heat but not the red color of chili peppers, such as a cream based sauce.  Since it only takes a drop to give me the heat that I want it will hardly change the color of a white sauce.My only reservations about it is that it contains hot pepper extract (which is what they call the stuff that they spray in the eyes of criminals).  I've seen hot pepper extract for sale as a commercial additive.  It's low on flavor but big on heat.  Was this added to give the sauce extra pain inducing heat while using fewer actual Jolokia peppers? I don't know but it makes you think.

Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it.

This is hands down the best sugar-free syrup I have ever had.  It is thick, with a good flavor, and only 35 calories per serving.

Chicory, with sugar beet and rye was used as an ingredient of the East German Mischkaffee (mixed coffee), introduced during the \"coffee crisis\" of 1976-9.\" Chicory is also related to endive and raddichio.Cafe au lait is strong coffee mixed half with hot milk, and sugar added as desired.

We were hot, sweaty, and more than a little worn out from having hoofed all over the historic district. It would take more than a few Dunkin Donuts to revive our exausted, jaded spirits and a whole lot more than a Krispee Kream to skewer our skepticism.The pastries needed to be fresh, hot, and Paris-pretty to impress us. The coffee had to be perfectly percolated to perk us up.What we had that morning (several plates of steaming, sinfully-sweet, precisely-powdered beignets) were tiny pillows of pastry perfection. The beignets were so good, we made several more early morning trips to Cafe du Monde during our stay in New Orleans. The coffee was utterly addictive, strong, lovely, full-bodied, with a rich aroma that could be detected long before we entered the shop.Once home, I experienced a serious post-perfect-beignet let-down. Krispee Kream no longer cut it. Starbucks was sadly unsatisfying.I was thrilled when I discovered I could buy Cafe du Monde's beignet mix and coffeee online. I ordered several boxes and cans, stocked up on a truck-load of powdered sugar, and anxiously waited by my mailbox. When the much-coveted beignet mix was finally delivered, I wasted no time in firing up the oil and brewing a pot of coffee.I was very pleased with the beignet mix and the chicory coffee. The directions were easy to follow (just add water) and the amount of mix in the box was generous for the price. Once properlly prepared, the beignets were just as delicious as those served at Cafe du Monde (of course, you do have that tiresome clean-up when you make them at home that you don't have when you go to the cafe in New Orleans, but all truly great things come with a price).Pefect patries and heavenly coffee.

It comes in cakes and must be ground either with a mortar & pestle or in a very sturdy grinder\/blender.  It is a basic recipe which suits the majority.  Therefore, if you want it to be super spicy, you need to dress it up a bit.  Follow the package instructions for best results but use a whisk.  It needs to be made in a saucepan on top of the stove or in a Mr. Coffee Cocomotion machine.Grind the cakes in advance for maximum convenience and use 1 and a half times the recommended amount for best results. Use whole milk for best results or 2%.  Skim milk just doesn't work as well. For a spicier mug of cocoa, add ground chili powder to taste.  You can also add a piece of vanilla bean while cooking if you like that.  If you want even more cinnamon taste, you can cook with a cinnamon stick. You can add espresso powder as well for a nice change of pace.  Instant coffee will do in a pinch plus that's a good way to get rid of intsant coffee!It's best to try a few mugs of Ibarra before you decide to spice it up.  The flavor will grow on you.

Two or three drops is all you'll need for a bloody mary and only a few more drops will add considerable heat to any family sized dish.The Habanero chile is one of the hottest chiles known to man and in its immature state its color is green. So these younger chiles are slightly less hot than then the older red ones.This is a pure heat source with little if any other flavor beyond the overwhelming heat. If you really think hard about this sauce you might (?) be able to detect a vague hint of vinegar (which is the Acetic Acid listed in the ingredients).Ingredients (as copied from the label): Water, Habanero Pepper, Salt, Acetic Acid (a chemical component of vinegar), .... etcConclusion: There is nothing special about this sauce beyond its considerable and concentrated heat. While there are some very vague vinegar notes (from the Acetic Acid) -  there is no real character to this sauce beyond pure heat.A better choice would be the El Yucateco Extra Hot Habanero Sauce. It is almost pure Habanero. It's major ingrediant is the Habanero pepper - not water. It is a bit hotter yet quite true to the pepper.If you decide to order this sauce --- Watch the seller's shipping charges which can often be excessive and won't drop even if you order multiple bottles at the same time.I'd pass on this hot sauce because of its lack of character - 3 stars is about right. But if you are looking for just pure heat then this sauce ALMOST hits that mark but the El Yucateco Extra Hot Habanero Sauce is better in that regard.I'll confess I'm not a big fan of the Habanero pepper but you may be.Tastes do differ so you may want to try this one.

I am a huge, yet disciminating, fan of hot suaces in general but this is by far my favorite right now.  I can handle a lot of heat as a regular hot sauce eater but this stuff is on a different scale than what you can get at the grocery store.  My husband won't come near this stuff.  It is so good I want to pour it on whatever I'm eating but it is sooooo hot I have to find that threshold of barely tolerable heat before it's so much I can't take it.  Of course, with continued dosage I can do more over time.  Our Publix and Kroger doesn't carry it so I have to go to the mercado\/taqueria and can only get the 4 oz. version so this time I actually bought three 8 oz. bottles here on Amazon (fiendish, I know).The flavor is excellent, uncomplicated and straight forward like fresh green habaneros blended with a bit of salt and a bit of vinegar.  It isn't thin or overly vinegary or too salty though like a lot of hot sauces. I think this is because there is more actual habaneros in there because it's a little thicker consistency with a bit of fine texture to it.  Also, the color is fabulous.  I don't know if they add food dye or not but it is this vibrant, almost neon grass green.  Love it.My favorite way to eat it is on simple things like carne asada with flour tortillas, avocado and shredded lettuce, on 'over medium' fried eggs, and it's perfect on fish tacos with cool slaw, raw white onion and ranch.  The Mexican restaurant where I first had this doesn't have it on the tables anymore (probably because it's too hot for most) but they take it and puree it fine with avocado for this outrageously hot guacamole\/habanero sauce thing that is just awesome.So obviously I love it and highly recommend it for experienced hot sauce people.","overall":5,"summary":"Addictive","unixReviewTime":1342051200,"reviewTime":"07 12, 2012"}

The winds keep howling, the temps keep dropping and the snow is pounding us like we owe the clouds money. Every day I'm bundling up and shoveling four feet of something -- snow, ice, stranded hybrids, Kennedys -- and I'm done with it. I just wanted to find some way to warm up.Also, to feel my toes again and have my [...] crawl back out of my rib cage. But I settled for trying to warm up.I've always heard that if you warm up on the inside, then the outside will follow. So I bought this bottle of El Yucateco and saved it for the next inevitable snowstorm. When I was done shoveling and still shivering, I opened it up and slammed it down the hatch -- all eight ounces.First, a few words about the taste: El Yucateco red has a nice tangy element, lingering through the forward habanero kick and beyond. The additional spices play well with the primary pepper, adding a savory depth that's more than just pure heat or capsaicin jolt. The tomato base and hearty thick texture promise a richness and complexity of flavor that is delivered quite nicely to the palate.And now, a few words about the unrelenting napalm burn that traveled around my mouth, down my gullet and -- over the next twelve hours or so -- into, through, and out my intestines, scorching and defiling every square millimeter of delicate insides that it touched: [...]Overall, I'd say this would make a very nice complement to a variety of Mexican or South American dishes, as well as grilled meats, starchy vegetables or as an extra kick to, say, garlicky green veggie side dishes. Also, it's unlikely that I'll be able to sit down without searing pain for at least a month.

I've been blind taste testing hot sauces for over 6 months. I have about 40 hot sauces in my house. I taste test them raw, and then with food; write up some notes and then a week or so later do the same thing again and then compare all my notes. I repeat this process again and again. Like I said: everyone needs a hobby. Frankly I wanted to settle on a few excellent brands because I love hot foods. So for about $75.00 I have a cabinet filled with hot sauces.The first thing that everyone needs to know is that a Chipotle based hot sauce is a sub-category within the hot sauce universe. The chipotle is a smoked jalape&ntilde;o&ntilde;o pepper, relatively mild and it has a rich, almost sweet flavor, and it is not that hot. I happen to love its taste but I have discovered there are a number of inferior sauces based on this pepper.The El Yucateco is at the very top of my list for this type of pepper. It has a rich smokey (almost sweet) flavor with some heat. Keep in mind, no chipotle based sauce has searing heat. This blend includes some sugar and even a bit of tomato. It's only competitor, according to my taste testing, would be Tabasco's Chipotle based sauce which is also excellent. Tabasco adds primarily vinegar to its blend while, as noted, El Yucateco adds sugar and tomato paste to theirs. Both seem a bit sweet and both have a low level of heat.  Either one of these brands is vastly superior to all the other Chipotle sauces I have taste tested.When you can find this sauce in stores, the average price is about $2.00FOR A COUPLE OF BUCKS YOU SHOULD TRY THIS ONE but watch out for Amazon sellers that offer a low price per bottle combined with high shipping charges, even when you order many bottles at the same time.Watch out for Amazon sellers that offer a low price but then charge a very high shipping charge on A PER BOTTLE BASIS. In other words, even if you order 6 bottles at the same time - a very high shipping charge will apply - based on the single bottle shipping rate. One way a SELLER can game the Amazon system is to offer a low price but correspondingly high shipping charges on a per bottle basis. Buyer beware!BEST BUY:El Yucateco Chipotle Hot Sauce, 5 FL OZ bottles (pack of 12) is your best buy at $30.00 with free shipping. That is only $2.50 per bottle delivered!","overall":5,"summary":"A Wonderful Blend. One of my top two Chipotle based hot sauces","unixReviewTime":1349568000,"reviewTime":"10 7, 2012"}

While there is nothing truly remarkable about it - more importantly - it has no obvious flaws.  It simply has a nicely balanced flavor and that alone is quite rare in hot sauces!!!! This sauce could or should be a staple in any kitchen.  I'm glad to have a bottle in my pantry.I would rate this sauce somewhere between mild and medium hot. You'll need more than a couple of drops but not much more than that to generate some heat in any dish. Compared to Tabasco's original you'll need about twice the number of drops.Ingredients (as copied from the label): Water, Red Peppers, Salt, Spices, Garlic, Acetic Acid (a component of vinegar), etc ......Note the relatively low level of vinegar within the sauce. That is a good thing. The type of red pepper is unknown but there is a natural sweetness to this sauce which I find quite pleasant. That sweetness balances nicely against the heat. View this sauce as a superior alternative to a very common benchmark - the original Tabasco hot sauce.Minor flaws: There is a bit too much salt in this sauce but that only becomes evident when used in an already heavily salted dish. For example: This is not the best choice for a Bloody Mary due to the heavily salted nature of most vegetable\/tomato juices.Since this sauce is available in 5 oz, 10 oz and 32 oz sizes - you'd be wise to pick up the 32oz size given the fact that it often costs little more than the smaller sizes.This is a fine basic hot sauce with a natural sweetness to it. This sauce is worthy of being a staple in any kitchen. It is better than most. What it lacks is that rare sense of freshness and, as noted, there is also a bit too much salt.","overall":4,"summary":"A nice blend.

We have bought over roasted beans that were little better than Starbucks French Roast.We have also bought Cromwell Estate peaberry (roasat to order and simply amazing) and until recently, we found that the best bang for the buck was the Costco Kona which you can only get on-island.When we ran out of the last batch of the Costco Kona, we took a gamble on this one and are really happy.Pros:- Medium roast is a real medium roast is highly consistent (leading to a MUCH better cup)- The coffee is truly fresh- The bean size is really consistent and there are no slubs (again leading to a beter cup)- The coffee has a complex flavor that develops over time with a lot of interesting secondary and tertiary flavors- Quality bag-to-bag is excellentCons:- If you like French Roast, this is NOT the coffee for you.

I was looking for some good holiday food and I read all the reviews and decided to go ahead and try it out and to my surprise I really enjoyed it and believe me I was expecting quite a bit for 30 dollar coffee.  The 1st thing I noticed was the aroma when I 1st broke into the package and it wasn't the normal aroma I was used to when breaking into new coffee for the 1st time.  The aroma was so much better and it was so much different and pleasing in smell that I knew it was going to be a great cup of coffee.  With anticipation I ground up the beans and made my 1st pot and actually just finished it before this was wrote.  I took my time drinking this coffee and I must say I have drank a lot of coffee in my time and thought I wouldn't be able to tell a difference but I found myself looking forward to my next cup.  The taste was so fantastic and full of flavor that I really didn't expect it so I was really surprised by that.

Once you've used it, all other vanillas seem weak or watered down in comparison. I've been using this brand exclusively for at least 5 years now. However, I always order their Vanilla extract & didn't even realize they offered a 'paste'.I wasn't looking closely when I ordered this and was surprised when I opened this and found it was a thicker, gel-like substance. My first concern was \"will it taste as good?\" followed by \"what is being used to thicken this stuff?\". The taste seems pretty equivalent and according to the label, a tsp. of this is equal to a tsp. of their vanilla extract. The thickener used is Gum tragacanth, which if you wiki it shows as being a gum from a middle eastern tree.Personally, I'd prefer to cook with stuff that doesn't have added thickeners, colorings, artificial flavorings etc., so going forward I will be sure to check the label and order the extract. However, I didn't see anything about the gum tragacanth to make me want to toss this bottle out and not use it at all.I do not think this has better or more intense flavor than the Nielsen-Massey Vanilla extract although others here have claimed this. You do see the little bits of vanilla bean in the gel\/paste, so if you like that \"look\" of vanilla bean specks in your ice cream, cake or whatever you're making then this will give you that. However, taste wise, it's not better plus you're adding a tree gum to your food.All-in-all I'll stick with the same brand vanilla extract going forward, but would be willing to order this paste again if their extract weren't available (because the taste of the Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla is far superior to every other vanilla I've used in the past (including home-made).","overall":3,"summary":"Accidentally ordered instead of the vanilla extract, it's ok but prefer their extract","unixReviewTime":1366675200,"reviewTime":"04 23, 2013"}

Early pioneers in pregnancy testing came up with the &#34;Friedman test.&#34;,  An improvement on the 1927 test developed by Bernhard Zondek and Selmar Aschheim that used mice (You can't sell dead mice on Amazon).  The rabbit test was an advance and consisted of injecting the tested woman's urine into a female rabbit. Examining the rabbit's ovaries a few days later you would find a change in response to a hormone only secreted by pregnant women. The hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), is produced during pregnancy and indicates the presence of a fertilized egg. The rabbit test became very popular and the supply of dead rabbits increased. The term &#34;rabbit test&#34; was first recorded in 1949 but became a common phrase in the English language. The people who didn't know any better thought the injected rabbit would die only if the woman was pregnant. The phrase &#34;the rabbit died&#34; became as euphemism for a positive pregnancy test. Actually all rabbits used for the test died, because they had to be surgically opened in order to examine the ovaries. While it was possible to do this without killing the rabbit, it was generally deemed not worth the trouble and expense, the cheapskates!  Due to medical advances, use of a live animal is no longer required. Folks the rabbits don't have to die. Don't promote their demise by purchasing this product.A replacement for the rabbit test uses frogs, specifically the African clawed frog, which like all frogs lays eggs instead of getting pregnant, and therefore can yield a positive result on the test without the need to be cut open in order to prove it.

Nicknamed \"Thumper\" for an endearing but nervous twitch of the left hind foot, he eventually became known throughout the world by that single name, joining the exclusive rank of one named stars such as Cher, Madonna and Pele.Cast as a child character in a small supporting role in the movie Bambi in 1942, Thumper's adorable and enduring persona lit the screen with a charisma way beyond that of a humble sidekick.A memorable line in Bambi became the touchstone of Thumper's life. \"If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all!\" formed the basis of what is now known as \"The Thumperian Principle\" . Grown to a world movement, Thumperian disciples believe in the tenant that bad grammar and good deeds are cosmically linked.Thumper continued work at the Disney Studios with Thumper2 and Thumper Goes Exploring but was eventually released from his contract when as a young adult, despite desperate efforts, he could not control the twitch in his hind leg. Rumors of drug abuse were never proven although Thumper spent several months at a private hospital for reported exhaustion  after completing the filming Thumper Goes Exploring.Never making the transition to television as did his younger relatives, Crusader Rabbit and Bugs Bunny, Thumper's career floundered until he was reduced to starring in three rabbitsploitation movies, \"Suck My Carrot\", \"Young Bunny Coed Love\", and finally, \"The Bunny Hole\".A long time alcoholic and well known visitor to the watering holes along the Sunset Strip and Las Vegas, Thumper lent his name to what has become a popular drinking game.Thumper spent his final years prior to his disappearance making celebrity appearances at Bambi reunions and Thumperian conferences and spent two seasons on Hollywood Squares where the muffled thumping of his hind led could often be heard in the background.Thumper was the founder and president of the \"Shake A Leg Foundation\" a research and charitable organization for rabbits and other small mammals suffering from hind leg movement disorder. Contributions to the foundation can be made in his name.Thumper is survived by his older brother, Benjamin Bunny, his nephew, Roger Rabbit, and his fourth wife, Jessica Rabbit and 974 children.","overall":3,"summary":"Thumper Rabbit RIP","unixReviewTime":1249948800,"reviewTime":"08 11, 2009"}

Sadly, I didn't think about 'alive' or 'unskinned', of which this thing is neither. So my idea of training it to hand out candy sort of went out the window.No matter. I stuffed the carcass full of Peeps and Reese's pieces, and strung it up by the legs in a tree in the yard. The kids took turns whacking at it with barbecue tongs until it all came tumbling out, like some sort of hairless Easter party pinata.I've never seen kids cry so much while they're picking up candy.

Chavin \"rmchavin\"","helpful":[17,19],"reviewText":"According to a scientific study of Japanese seaweed eaters, \"When kombu is boiled in water for 15 minutes, it can lose up to 99% of its iodine content, while iodine in sargassum, a similar brown seaweed, loses around 40% [28,29]. Processed kelp is often boiled in dye for half an hour (\"ao-kombu\" or \"kizami-kombu\") before hanging to dry [21], a process which can reduce seaweed iodine content before it is consumed. When kelp is used to flavor soup stocks, the seaweed is often removed after boiling, resulting in soup stock high in iodine.\"Many people avoid eating kombu because it contains way too much iodine.  According to the Linus Pauling Institute, people with an extremely high iodine intake will substantially increase their risk of developing thyroid papillary cancer but substantially decrease their risk of developing thyroid follicular cancer.  Thyroid papillary cancer is less aggressive and has a better prognosis than thyroid follicular cancer.However, iodine, selenium, and zinc are the 3 antioxidant minerals in human nutrition.  In my opinion, a high intake of these 3 beneficial antioxidant minerals might very likely slightly lower our risk of developing all cancers.  Thyroid cancer is extremely rare.  Even in Japan, where people eat a huge quantity of iodine from seaweed, only 1 man in 100,000 develops thyroid cancer and only 3 women in 100,000 develop thyroid cancer.  Hiroshima and Nagasaki had the highest rates of thyroid cancer in Japan, not the northeast coast of Japan where seaweed consumption is extremely high.Technically, \"brown\" seaweeds such as kombu (kelp), arame (kelp), limu moui (kelp), wakame, mozuku, and hijiki are not plants.  Biologists have placed \"brown\" seaweeds under Kingdom Chromalveolata instead of Kingdom Plantae.  However, \"red\" seaweeds such as nori (laver), ogo (limu), and dulse are classified as plants.  \"Brown\" seaweeds have rootlike structures that cling to the ocean bottom but they lack true roots, true stems, and true leaves.  Also, all \"brown\" seaweeds are rich in the extremely beneficial marine polysaccharide, fucoidan, and the extremely beneficial marine carotenoid, fucoxanthin.  By contrast, green vegetables growing on land and \"red\" seaweeds are rich in the carotenoids, lutein, zeaxanthin, neoxanthin, and violaxanthin but contain zero fucoxanthin and zero fucoidan.Biologists have shown that the reason why nobody who lives within 300 miles of the ocean has ever developed an iodine deficiency is because the kelp growing near the shoreline manufacture large amounts of iodine gas which escapes to float above the surface of the ocean and gets blown inland by the wind.Attached to the surface of all \"brown\" seaweeds are probiotic saltwater bacteria which manufacture an enzyme which allows humans to digest the extremely beneficial polysaccharides and extremely beneficial carotenoids in \"brown\" seaweeds.  Without these probiotic saltwater bacteria, \"brown\" seaweeds would pass through our digestive tracts without being digested.Yes, this product is delicious but because salt always contains cancer-causing nitrosamines, it's a good idea to soak this product in water for at least 5 minutes to remove as much salt as possible.  This product was farmed in the coastal areas of South Korea.","overall":5,"summary":"99% of the iodine can be removed by boiling the kombu for 15 minutes","unixReviewTime":1381276800,"reviewTime":"10 9, 2013"}

I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference.

It did not have a bitter or odd taste, not to me.  I drank it hot without honey.  It was a bit of a diuretic and I felt it gave me a bit more energy somehow, but it did not make a noticeable difference in my cold-like symptoms related to mucous and my nose.

If you want (bagged) high quality chamomile tea, stick to all-flowers, high-quality potent Traditional Medicinals brand. This produced-going by their exact instructions and a couple of variations-a browner tea than pure chamomile flowers produce (darker in this case does NOT mean potent-chamomile is golden and it should only ever become a more saturated yellow if steeped at rich concentrations, never even approaching brown or apple cider type coloration), and just as crucially it tasted more twiggy and was far less aromatic with nearly none of the sweet apple-cherimoya tastes than any good chamomile.While I do tend to brew loose tea&am; picky about the actual bags used by any given brand (chemical bleaching will destroy all tea), bags are nearly essential when my time to get tea is limited to pouring water over the tea and covering it to steep at my work area and another ten seconds to squeeze the bag out and toss the tea. Still, I won't be taking this anywhere-the two unused boxes will go to a food bank since I'm sure someone will appreciate it if only as something hot and free of caffeine. Frankly, Celestial Seasonings makes tea better than the two Alvita single-ingredient options I purchased.One thing I tend to do with every new tea  try is analyze the actual tea itself, always wet but often dry as well. This one's prominence of stems (a 1.5cm one punctured the bag in pushing out the liquid with a spoon against the little ramekin lid I cover my cups with), the dusty brown flecks of what I presume are chamomile flowers-very poorly handled ones!-and the end result leave me writing a review urging you to go elsewhere. If you want bagged tea, Traditional Medicinals' chamomile--which is all flower, twice as flavor (and nutrient)-rich as Alvita gram for gram, and can be steeped essentially indefinitely(til the bag breaks down) without becoming bitter, which is true of nearly all pure chamomile(that isn't treated with pesticides or in treated bags etc), especially Egyptian varieties-- is so far the best I've found. Two bags of this cannot compete with ONE of theirs and if you steep Alvita beyond a few minutes your tea will be bitter and woody-tannins and other bitter components are from the stems, not the flower.If you are able and willing to do the extra minute of work, getting loose WHOLE Egyptian chamomile flowers whose quality you can visibly assess (including how long they've been sitting around) is by far your best bet-cheapest, too, and a Chinese tea gallery can sell you a cute little handled double-layer mesh strainer for a few dollars-I personally use my Pyrex measuring cups to steep so I can easily pour the golden (in this case-iodine red or kiwi green or whatever other shade it turns out) liquid into my drinking vessel and if the ingredients are suited to multiple steepings like oolong or pu'ehr steep again without too much awkwardness.The tl;dr essence of this: look elsewhere-this is extremely poor chamomile, whether you ask me, a diligent grower, or an expert-this is not advertised as twiggy tea (it'd be the wrong component anyway) and you likely aren't looking for an infusion from taking boiling water to hay-like splintery stems. For shame, Alvita. For shame.Try this instead: [[B0009F3PM6:Traditional Medicinals Organic,Chamomile, 16-Count Boxes(Pack of 6)]]You won't regret it.","overall":1,"summary":"Poor quality tea full of sharp hay-like bitter stems","unixReviewTime":1392508800,"reviewTime":"02 16, 2014"}

As for the Alvita brand, my senses tell me...Smell: Good! Same nutty aroma that resembles roasted tahini, or peanut brittle.Color: Medium brown, with some reddish tone. Not as dark as Traditional Medicinals.Taste: Good, but not the best I've tasted. Initial flavor like some kind of nutty coffee drink is all there and good, just not as rich.

I started drinking this last time I got a caution that my liver enzymes were boderline high. I have yet to confirm that it helped, but the psychological benefits are helping a bit ;). It tastes good, and somewhat resembles hot coffee in the morning, only more healthier.On a comparitive note, the tea bags themselves are cheap. They do not have draw strings like most tea bags have, they are not individually sealed or wrapped, and they come grouped together in a non-resealing package. If this doesn't effect you that much, then I would recommend this buy because you get more tea bags for your money. Otherwise, I think you will get a better experience with Traditional Medicinals.

How amazing, the seller will not provide the proper images of the product after complaint.

Spectrum VCO are identified as Essentials but for cooking it is identified as Naturals.I use VCO in the mix for my hair, shaving cream, soap, hand lotion, face lotion, body lotion, tooth paste as well as I make popcorn and consume it straight out of the jar for its nutrients. Years ago, I was able to get raw, hand pressed coconut oils from fresh coconuts from Mexico produced right here in US but due to popularity of VCOs, many producers have been creative in making money by misleading shoppers as well as many misleading reviews by shoppers certainly has hyped the business of VCO to another level. Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is a lie since Extra Virgin applies only to olive oil and infact the VCO market has become so saturated that many producers are removing extra from their labeling and calling it virgin coconut oil, no more extra virgin. In Canada where the best VCOs are produced, it is illegal to even use the term, extra virgin for coconut oil but in US the laws are very relaxed. There is no Extra Virgin coconut oil, only virgin, there is no pure, no #1, no 100%, no premium liquid, or any of those terms used for coconut oils. There is no coconut oil especially produced for beauty product which is any different than for cooking or consumption either as a salad dressing or right out of the jar with a spoon. The higher the grade, the higher the nutrients, everything else are marketing tools to sell coconut oil for more money.REFINED or UNREFINED: The decision to choose between refined vs. unrefined is dependent upon the intention or use of the oil.

My wife wanted to feed him the way nature intended and we were visited by a lactation nurse at the hospital. She advised us and said that if we ever had problems with obtaining enough milk, we might try Fenugreek, a supplement available at health-food stores. Of course, we forgot the peculiar name shortly thereafter. Well, my wife started to have difficulties a few weeks later in keeping up with the baby's growing needs.  We mentioned the problem to a young couple who had a recent child. The woman said she had the same problem and told us to get Fenugreek. She said it had worked for her. There was that strange-sounding word again.We purchased Nature's Way Fenugreek shortly thereafter. Strange stuff. It's an herbal supplement in capsule form, but the label doesn't say what it's for. I guess you just have to know. Evidently, it's one of those things that takes a certain amount of faith. Anyway, since we heard about it from two completely independent sources, my wife started taking it. Well, it wasn't a miracle. There was no immediate change. However, my wife gradually began to keep up with the baby's needs and has kept up ever since. Was it the Fenugreek? Perhaps. Maybe she was just adapting to the new baby. It's hard to tell.

Dawson","helpful":[8,13],"reviewText":"I'm a working mother who was suffering from a steadily decreasing milk supply after returning to work.  Despite pumping every three hours at work (for a total of 3 pumping sessions per day), I was starting to have to top off my baby's bottles with frozen milk from my freezer stash.  At first it was an extra ounce a day, then two, then three.  As any breastfeeding mother knows, that's a dangerous road to go down because it can lead to even more supply issues in the future.I decided to try supplementing with fenugreek, but because I am naturally very suspicious of supplements and worried about side effects, I did a ton of research on the pros\/cons of fenugreek before starting supplementation.  My research suggests that fenugreek can have an effect on blood sugar levels, so people with blood sugar issues should consult a doctor before trying the supplement.  I've learned to minimize the blood sugar effects for myself by always taking my fenugreek right after eating my main meals.  This way, the blood sugar effects are more than offset by the food in my system.The biggest mistake people make when trying fenugreek to increase milk supply is to not take enough of the herb.  It is critical to take enough, or you will not see any effect.  Some women can see an effect by taking 2 610mg pills three times a day (for a total of 6 pills a day).  Personally, I had to increase my dosage to 3 610mg pills three times a day (for a total of 9 pills a day) to get the desired effect.  Also, you have to be very consistent and really work hard not to skip any doses.  After a couple days of starting supplementation, I saw an increase in my supply, so I am now able to pump enough milk for my baby's bottles during the day while I am at work.  Thanks to the fenugreek, I'm getting a 2-3 ounce boost per day, which is not a huge amount, but it's all I needed.

Fenugreek was prescribed and it made a huge difference. Based on what the doctor told me you can try the following if you have twins or simply need to increase your milk supply:* Fenugreek is very helpful, 2 capsules three times a day with meals, eventually working your way up to 4 capsules per meal. The body gets used to it after a while so the doctor suggested going off it for a couple of days and restarting.* Nurse 8-12x a day, putting each baby to breast until they empty it (do not time it) - the baby is much more effective than the pump at drawing the milk out than even a hospital pump, and will help increase your supply. In effect, interrupting the feeding could be counterproductive.* You can decrease the # of sessions if the amount pumped is more than 1000 ml\/ 24 hrs (try pumping instead of nursing for one day to measure). You can also try weighing the baby to calculate intake, using a baby scale in grams (same as mls for calculating). Note - this will be a rough estimate as the baby may be getting more milk than the pump - and some women are unable to pump much even if they can nurse well.* Alternate sides for the babies, as one may have a stronger suck. It's possible one side will have a lot more milk than another. How you hold the baby also affects supply - if you're right handed that side will hold the baby more firmly and they may nurse longer and increase supply more on that side. All normal.* After breastfeeding the baby, pump but only for 5 minutes or so to increase demand on your body and thus milk production. Frequency is much more important than duration. Pumping for 20 min has little effect according to the doctor (I know, \"now I find out?!\" that's what I said)* If you have twins, read the bookMothering Multiples: Breastfeeding and Caring for Twins or More! (La Leche League International Book)by Karen Kerkhoff Gromada. I wish I had read this early on. It provides solid advice on breastfeeding multiples plus a whole lot more up to 2 yrs of age.* Try to eat well and sleep at least 6 hrs. Your milk production is directly related to your health and stress levels.* If you're able to breastfeed exclusively great but if you can't don't beat yourself up over it it's Ok to supplement (we used Enfacare as my babies were low weight, then Enfamil Premium for one and Alimentum for our other). You have a lot on your hands to worry about.* Don't try to do all feedings alone, you'll go crazy. Have your hubby do the last feeding of the night 10 or 11 pm and the early morning one (6 or 7 am) - you do the ones in between. This way, you'll each get a solid chunk of sleep. The one who's not \"on shift\" stays in the quiet bedroom without a monitor but with a cell phone. We had an extra bed in the nursery so it would be easier to nurse the babies - if I needed help (two babies crying at the same time or you're too tired) I'd call my hubby on the cell phone, but this rarely happens if you stage feedings (always feed twin A first for example). My hubby comes in at 6 am or whenever and quietly feeds the babies before they wake up so I can sleep until 8 or so.* I kept my energy and supply up withEnsure Plus - Vanillaand oatmeal.* Google \"manual expression Stanford University\", the video shows how to increase your milk supply significantly using manual expression. It works better than any other method even if it feels unusual.* If you do supplement and trying to increase breastfeeding, don't stop bottle feeding cold turkey (you may not have enough milk supply as supplementing may lower supply). Continue to supplement and give 1 oz or so BEFORE starting to nurse. The reason for this is that bottlefed babies are used to a faster flow and ready supply, with nursing it takes longer for the milk to let down. Giving the bottle-fed baby some formula before nursing will take the edge off his hunger and keep him from \"chomping away at the bit\" if you will - in other words it will calm him down and make the nursing experience more relaxing for mom & baby and allow baby to nurse longer.* Try a brief warm shower or use warm compresses (try putting warm water in a diaper) before nursing to stimulate milk let down.* Keep your eyes off the clock. Another reason to not interrupt or time breast feeding - the hind milk that lets down after the baby has been nursing a while is richer and higher in fat, more satisfying for the baby. If you stop after \"X\" minutes you may not get the hind milk.* Continue nursing 8-12x a day - don't wait too long before feedings (4+ hrs), any sign of engorgement is letting your body know there's less demand and will reduce milk production. Nursing every 2-3 hours is better, allow a stretch of 4 hours early in your sleeping cycle to feel better rested (have your hubby feed baby late at night).* Pump for a few minutes each time you nurse to simulate increased demand and boost milk production. Manual milk expression and fenugreek will also help and over time you'll need to supplement less as your milk production increases.* If you find that your supply is going down again, stop using Fenugreek for a few days, as according to doctors your body will get used to it after a while. Restart a few days later as if were from the beginning (2 capsules, 3x a day with meals, increasing to 4 x3 over time).* Don't do marathon pumping. As soon as you start feeling stressed or find yourself wondering how many ounces you've pumping, etc. you're overthinking things and this will affect your milk supply. Stop for a few minutes and go do something else. Then pump a little more. You can leave it out at room temperature while you do this - mark the time you started & date on tape w\/ a Sharpie pen to be safe. If you wait 15-30 min or so, it counts as an additional pumping session (if you're trying to fit more in).* Pumping is not always a good indicator of your real milk supply (some women may not be able to pump much but nurse well) - a baby scale is the most accurate measurement if you really want to know (don't stress this too much, just nurse until baby seems full).* Feed on demand and expect cluster feeding (every 1-2 hrs) at the witching hour and just before a growth spurt.* For me at least I always had to supplement with twins because I never had enough milk for two. I did see a huge increase in my milk supply from very little to being able to nurse one baby full time for a while. Fenugreek was a HUGE help.Lastly, this tip from a sleep doctor - to handle sleep deprivation log how many hours total you slept at night (even if interrupted), find the midway point and add 12 hours. Try to take a 30-60 minute nap then, this is your natural down-time according to your inner clock and will be much better than trying to catch up on sleep on the weekends (example - slept 12am -6 am, midway point is 3 am add 12 hrs - try to nap @ 3 pm.) Keep a log of how long you sleep each time - always try to get at least 6 hrs.With Fenugreek, enough sleep, a good diet and the tips above, your milk supply should increase.*** UPDATE 12\/27\/12 - another reviewer has found that Fenugreek can trigger an allergic reaction in anyone allergic to peanuts, as they are in the same family. Please see comments section for links to study. (Thank you G. Jager for this important info).

The fact that it contains phyto-estrogens just complicates things further if you're concerned about testosterone levels. But sometimes things that look a bit crazy seem to work out well in unexpected ways.I started using fenugreek a year ago, discontinued it because of the testosterone concerns, and recently restarted it to help moderate anxiety symptoms from a choline-related medication I had just started. Since fenugreek's action appears analogous in many ways to oxytocin (a hormone closely related to empathy and the mitigation of fear\/anxiety responses), I thought it might help to defuse these reactions. It was at least worth a shot.It does seem to have helped with the anxiety reactions (I combined it with l-glutamine for those who are really interested). What surprised me completely was the very strong boost in libido that I experienced inside of three days. And when I went back and doublechecked the research on fenugreek, I found that a mid-2011 report by Australian researchers showed a 25 percent increase in male libido for those using fenugreek. So objective research says this effect of fenugreek is real. Subjectively, I know that this supplement is way more effective for me than things like saw palmetto that are commonly marketed for libido boosts.And I wasn't even looking for this effect. But it works, and this is one of those side-effects that's a keeper. Beyond this, fenugreek is commonly used around the world by both sexes to help with type 2 diabetes. It appears to help with blood-sugar levels, but I can't say definitively that it works. It's inexpensive enough to be worth trying.My hoped-for long-term use for fenugreek is actually to help with what Buddhists call metta meditation, that is, focusing on lovingkindness. Research by the Center for Affective Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin suggests that expert meditators on lovingkindness modulate the functioning of the amygdala, a component of the brain that helps to establish empathic reactions and, once again, is closely associated with oxytocin. My experience so far is that fenugreek does in fact help with empathy. This makes eminent sense. Lactation and mother-child bonding pretty much go hand in hand.If you're interested in the underlying neurophysiology, you can probably do a much better job than me in researching this. If you're just a guy who could use a shot in the arm for lovemaking, then this is a worthwhile supplement even if we can't figure out all the physiology involved. Even if none of the above effects interests you, fenugreek is used for and may help with many other things, such as digestion (see Wikipedia for more information on such uses).I hope some of this proves helpful.","overall":5,"summary":"Helps to boost male libido","unixReviewTime":1333929600,"reviewTime":"04 9, 2012"}

I can't afford a procedure, so this was my next option, although I was very skeptical to it actually working. But, it did! Now, the results were not huge and dramatic, but they are slightly and noticeably fuller and perkier after several months of taking the combo-it does take that long to notice a difference, so be faithful if you decide to try it.  It works because it increases estrogen in the body.  As with any natural product, you need to evaluate if this is a good thing for you to try or not.  Increasing estrogen can be an issue for some women with other problems( uterine, cysts, etc), so please do your research.  Many of my supplements are from Nature's Way, because they don't often use stearates in their products, if avoidable.  This brand is very pure, the ingredients in this are (per two capsules) fenugreek seed 1,220 mg, gelatin and silica.  I don't care for gelatin, so I just open the capsules and pour out the powder in a bit of water when I am ready to take them.

(I am not a medical doctor, nurse practitioner or even a Phd. If you are experiencing more than occasional constipation, you need to see a doctor.)Don't drink this tea all the time. It's like taking any laxative too often; it will stop being effective. Also, be sure to drink at least a glass of water after you finish the tea. More if you can.. I will sometimes drink half the tea and then let it sit overnight (covered) with the tea bag in it and finish the rest in the morning. If I'm especially \"stuffed up\" I'll use two tea bags.I use one Splenda packet to sweeten it. It's pretty sweet on its own; you may not need to add anything. Or a bit of honey is nice.The active ingredient is the herb \"senna.\" Just because it's not a prescription medication, doesn't mean it's not powerful. In fact, there are prescription laxative medications that are based on senna.The first time you use the tea, I highly recommend trying it in the morning when you can spend the day relaxing and near a bathroom. Nothing worse  than finding out in the middle of a date that this tea really works for you! (I'm lucky; my man of 16 years is so used to me and my \"issues\" I don't have to be embarrassed.)Eveyone's system is different. There are many factors that impact its effectiveness as a laxative. Don't be discouraged if it doesn't work the first time or right away. It's a trial and error process. For me, drinking half of it before bed and the other half upon waking (with the tea bag(s) still in it) often works by mid-morning.I microwave a 16 or 20 ounce mug of water for 3 1\/2 minutes. Then, dump the bag(s) and the sweetener, if using, in the boiled water. Cover it with a plate and let it sit until it's cool enough to drink (about 10 minutes).Even if it works, it's a good idea to clean yourself out completely every 1-3 months.

My baseline product is Knox gelatin with which I am most familiar because I have been using it for years as it comes from the grocery. So far everything I have tried is MUCH better than Knox!!I decided to try this product for two reasons. First, because it is a powdered product much the same as Knox and would therefore be easy to compare. Second, because it is a bovine (beef assumedly..??) product that is differentiated from other gelatins that are pork based. I have also tried sheet gelatins (pork..) which were excellent in all respects and some gel capsules which were of no consequence at all.My main usage for gelatin is nutritional in nature as a protein enhancement to diet and as a gelling agent for aspics and a thickener for other mostly liquid preparations. Knox gelatin always worked....but I wanted something that was cleaner and clearer, smelled better and was easy to use.This product comes nicely packaged and because it is in a bulk container can be easily measured in varying quantities...something not easily done with Knox. When mixed according to directions, it forms a warm liquid that is clearer than Knox and has less odor. I am not certain about its gelling strength, mostly because I haven't directly compared it to Knox on that basis. I would need to weigh out the amounts used to properly determine that and then measure it by volume as well to eliminate possible inconsistencies with formulation and settling in packaging. I haven't taken the time to do that yet, although I probably will.So far I haven't found anything to dislike about this product. It meets all of my original criteria which I admit are largely subjective in nature, in that relative clearness, and odor are in the eyes of the user.....but I CAN see, smell, and taste the difference. Everything that makes me happy!I will admit here that the sheet gelatins have become my favorites for a lot of different preparations. They are so clean and so easy to use. However, for those applications where you would use a powdered gelatin, small amounts, quick thickening or easy protein supplementation in a single serving size possibly.....this product will more than meet your needs. Easily measured and used and packaged to maintain freshness, this product is SO much better than similar grocery items....Try it...I think you'll like it!!","overall":4,"summary":"Gelatin is Gelatin...Or is it??","unixReviewTime":1374624000,"reviewTime":"07 24, 2013"}

Unfortunately, while this is a good honey, it is basically a crystallized unprocessed honey with nice smoother creamed texture than typical aged granular honey. While it is marginally better than store-bought processed honey with flatter flavor and caramelized stronger aftertaste, it ultimately left me wondering \"What's the big deal?\" The Y.S. Organic raw honey is a product of Brazil & Canada, and it's worth a try if you've never tasted raw unfiltered honey before. However, I recommend that you lookout for fresh unprocessed honey from your local bee farmers instead, which may also help you ward off allergy symptoms to your local allergens. Those will taste more like the popular Honey Spoons candy (sold at Cracker Barrel) without the distinct complex flavor of aged crystallized honey which is what this honey ultimately tastes like.

It arrived in enough bubble wrap to protect the jar from a drop of at least 100 feet. Quite impressive. It took me a minute with a knife to get it all off. The honey itself was pretty hard on top but was softer about an eighth inch in. Taste was perfect. I spent half a day slowly heating it and it eventually became a viscous liquid but after 2 days it appears to be crystallizing again. It's not that bad because I kind of liked the sensation of the honey melting in my mouth, slowly releasing the sweetness.

I kicked in one and didn't even have to worry about the chest sputum it cleared.  I do believe that the combination of meds with the natural organic raw honey helped me to recuperate much quicker than normal.All this aside, it is great for teas and to take alone especially if sore throat or cough.  I tastes great. Definitely recommend.","overall":5,"summary":"Dbp323","unixReviewTime":1337299200,"reviewTime":"05 18, 2012"}

Either water it down to be thinner to wash your face with or put honey on your face as a facial.  Once the honey has set on your skin for about 10 minutes, press your fingers (flattened hand) against the honey and pull.  Yes, sticky.  Do this for several minutes all over your face. It helps to pull toxins out of your skin and stimulates blood flow. Your skin is left sparkling clean.* Raw honey has antibiotic properties which is why they say to put honey in warm water and sip. It helps  coat the throat and reduce irritation.* For blocked sinuses, mix a teaspoon or so in a pot of hot water and then put the towel over your head and inhale the steam.  Again, the antibiotic properties help with a sinus infection.* To treat allergies the honey should be local so the bees have made the honey from the local pollen.* A spoonful (ok, a heaping spoonful) in my coffee or tea gets a burst of energy.I love the texture, I love the taste.

{"reviewerID":"A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP","asin":"B00014JNI0","reviewerName":"NYFB","helpful":[6,8],"reviewText":"This is a very delicious, pure, true raw USDA organic honey.REAL HONEY: Raw honey is expensive. USDA organic honey is more expensive than just even organic honey without the stamp of USDA. To combine RAW and USDA organic and add qualities like Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup, makes it the true honey not glucose tasting like honey. For that reason that superior product, that superior superfood never sells in big buckets, or hardly ever in any container over 16 oz jar.FILTERING: At country's top honey packers, Dutch Gold, in Lancaster, PA, raw honey gets pumped through layers of white filters. Before the honey hit the filters, a powdered sedimentary rock called diatomaceous earth is added. This is a standard, widely used process. It removes all the pollen, along with dust, bees' wings, and, of course, the diatomaceous earth.ORGANIC HONEY: Organic honey doesn't go through nearly as fine a filter since organic rules prohibit the use of diatomaceous earth in the filtering process but regardless it is not a raw honey just because organic.VARIETY: Weather, location, flower type and season impact the coloring, taste and viscosity of honey produced by bees. Honey by the cost will hardly even crystallize. Tupelo sold by YS is raw although runny and pourable which will not crystallize due to its high moisture content. If from outside of US then Fair Trade stamp has some assurances of fair treatment of workers although not true in every case.CHINESE HONEY: Chinese honey famous for \"ultrapurified,\" a technique that can involve diluting honey with extra water, running it through extremely fine filters, and then removing the water. The process filters out much more and produces a sweet substance that is no longer honey. The process removes any pollens and the possibility of identifying the source of honey. Chinese honey is barred from the U.S. not because it's unsafe, but because U.S. officials decided it was too cheap. Chinese honey has had more than its share of safety problems. But there's also plenty of perfectly good Chinese honey for sale on the world market. EU is fussier about honey quality than the US, yet EU imports lots of honey from China but not US.QUALITY: A honey is only as good as the producer and regardless of all marketing and claims by sellers, there is no assurance that a jar of honey is full of pollen, unheated or unfiltered at 100 degree instead of 130 degree. Even if the honey was heated only to 90 degree at the time of production, the honey jar could be sitting in a storage or while being transported in containers that the temperatures can easily exceed 100 degrees. The only assurance that I have is purchasing honey from a producer with high quality reputation and a seller with high turnover. Wedderspoon brand and New Zealand are on top of my list. Purchasing Wedderspoon directly from Wedderspoon or authorized distributor is the only assurance I have for proper storage, pollen and enzymes that honey is consumed for.USES: I consume honey not by labeling but by the amount of pollen it carries. Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup from only trusted brands. I consume honey all the time since it has many nutritional benefits for me. I consume after any meal since it helps digestion. I used to consume chocolate years ago but I do not anymore since I consume pure cocoa which I add to my power drinks. I am into many sports and quality honey is the best quick energy I can get to boost my immune system and give myself a healthy rush of energy when I am in middle of my mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, surfing, etc. I drink lots of tea and I never use honey instead I use molasses. Molasses does not lose its nutritional value when heated but any heat to raw honey kills the quality enzymes and pollen in honey so I only consume honey straight out of the jar with spoon in moderation due to its high calories. Honey is the best ointment for all my scabs in mountain biking trails. After a day when my wounds are sealed I place raw honey for rejuvenation and it is the best healer of all instead of using Neosporin which loosens the scab and removes the scab, leaving scars on my skin.

Any time you can afford organic I believe it's worth the extra money because it's all about your health, not just taste. Everything you eat affects your health. You either pay extra now for the good stuff, or you pay a lot more later in the way of doctor bills and possibly even an early death.I get raw (unheated, never heat treated) honey from a friend now and then, she has her own hives, and Y.S. Organic honey is just as good if not better. Don't tell her, but I think this may be better than hers because her raw honey is not certified organic and kosher. Who knows where her bees have been. ;)I know honey can taste different depending on what flowers the bees pollinate, and I'm not sure what kind of honey this is (what kind of flowers) but the flavor is just right. Not too mild, not too strong, not too sweet. I know I sound like Goldie Locks, but it's just right.With honey bees rapidly disappearing from the world (scientists don't know why) I like the idea of organic hives - making sure chemicals are not spread around that may harm the bees as well as the people who eat their honey.One word of caution though, when you shop for this honey. If you don't read the label carefully you might buy one that is not organic. Y.S. Bee Farms makes both organic and not organic, and they are both raw and unpasteurized. I uploaded photos to show you the two different bottles (see above). Organic is in glass jars, and more expensive. Non-organic is in plastic jars and a little less money. But if you don't look closely you may think the non-organic is organic because the name of the company is \"Y.S. Organic Bee Farms\", and that name is on all jars, organic or not. To make sure your honey, or any food item, is truly organic, make sure it has the certified organic seal, as this product does.~ ~ ~What you should know about raw honey vs. pasteurized honey:Raw honey is the concentrated nectar of flowers gathered by bees (naturally, that's what they do) that comes straight from the bee hive (through an extracting process in a controlled setting). Raw honey is unheated, pure, unpasteurized, and unprocessed. Raw honey is the healthiest choice amongst the various forms of honey as it has the most nutritional value and contains amylase, an enzyme concentrated in flower pollen which helps predigest starchy foods like breads. Raw honey often has a thick yellow look to it, almost like yellow wax, when at cooler room temperatures. If the room is warmer it may turn a more golden color and look like a very thick syrup.Honey is an alkaline-forming food, which means raw honey contains ingredients similar to those found in fruits, which become alkaline in the digestive system. It doesn't ferment in the stomach and it can be used to counteract acid indigestion. When mixed with ginger and lemon juices, it also relieves nausea and supplies energy.Most of the honey found in the supermarket is not raw. You can usually tell the difference by looking at it, when it's not raw it usually looks like a thick amber liquid you can almost see through, like a light colored thin syrup. This is because it has been processed and pasteurized (heated at 70 degrees Celsius or more, followed by rapid cooling) and filtered so that it looks cleaner and smoother, more appealing on the shelf, and easier to handle and package because it's not as thick as raw honey.Pasteurization kills any yeast cell in the honey and prevents fermentation. It also slows down the speed of crystallization in liquid honey and that's why it looks \"cleaner\" and smoother. But, when honey is heated and pasteurized its delicate aromas, yeast and enzymes (that are responsible for activating vitamins and minerals in the body system) are partially destroyed. For this reason raw honey is assumed to be more nutritious than honey that has undergone heat treatment.CAUTION:  Bee products may cause allergic reactions in some people. Honey is not recommended for children under two.","overall":5,"summary":"Better than having your own bee hive!","unixReviewTime":1340496000,"reviewTime":"06 24, 2012"}

Vegemite is a tad smoother, but that's all).The consistency and colour are a bit like chocolate mousse but much thicker. It is a bit softer than Vegemite though. The predominant flavour is salty, with a noticeable aftertaste of bitter, and a hint of smoke and beer. Ignore the promotions that suggest it's a spread: it is most certainly not a spread -- if you spread it on a slice of bread like jam or butter, you'll vomit: it's too bitter in such a huge quantity. Better do this: spread some nice butter on your bread, generous amount, and then add no more than quarter teaspoon of this thing. You don't have to spread it: me, I just scoop it from the bottle and eat. Take a bite out of your bread, and then 1\/4 tsp of Marmite directly off the spoon. Or you can try to spread it, but it's thicker than butter and it'll be hard to smother it evenly over butter, it'll clump and remain in one place (too much of it). A small amount does it, don't gorge, it's a strong flavour. It also works great with zesty greens, like arugula, for example. Well, there isn't much else to say: it's great stuff, and I can heartily recommend it.Don't listen too much to the talk of its being an \"acquired taste\", only for the Brits, etc. It's a normal condiment that all people will like, I believe. Which brings me to one very significant moment: it's absurdly overpriced. I would put it in the same category as, say, soy sauce, or salsa, and it should cost about the same too.Btw, don't get it here, get it locally: it's a bit more expensive but there's no shipping, so the overall cost will be much lower. I get it in Whole Foods, for the obscene seven\/forty-nine a small jar (but it's less than overall here though), or, when they have it (not always), at Wegman's, for the less-unreasonable four\/ninety-nine. Good stuff, but needs to be much cheaper, when will Unilever come to their senses? I think a fair price for Marmite would be like, say, three dollars for 250 grams (and it shouldn't be sold in such small jars either: 250 grams is the smallest that'd make sense, 'cause like it is, I finish it off, alone, in less than two days and have to go buy another jar). In my view, Marmite should come in 250 gram, half a kilo, and a kilo packages -- and cost a fraction of what it costs right now. It's even more expensive than Vegemite (who is available at Wegman's, for about six bucks at the time of posting). These two similar products are quite agreeable, but six to eight bucks a tiny jar is way too much, it's an insolence really. I can't give good rating to this product in view of these prices, therefore: product itself is five stars; prices one star: our overall rating here is therefore three stars.","overall":3,"summary":"Toothsome condiment, absurdly overpriced.","unixReviewTime":1315353600,"reviewTime":"09 7, 2011"}

To use Marmite, spread it thinly on toast or sandwich bread. Wait! What do you mean by \"thinly?\" I mean, practically thin enough to be  a monolayer of molecules, because if you spread it any thicker, it will taste pretty strong. Well, actually, I use a quarter of a teaspoon on each piece of toast, which is buttered first to lubricate the process. And wait, how would one spread it thinly on fresh, untoasted AMERICAN bread without it tearing the fluffy crumb into tiny balls only suitable for feeding the koi? Again, a bit of softened butter, then a schmear of Marmite, a slice of tomato and you have a super tea sandwich. This is often my dinner, when I want something light.How and why was Marmite invented, and how did it become a beloved British traditional food, right up there with hedgehog-flavoured potato crisps? Back in 1902, some genius took the lees of good old British Ale, that is to say, Brewer's Yeast, and boiled it down to a tarry, black substance that no one in their right mind would eat unless their Mum forced them to. Because of the B-complex, Marmite became popular as a supplement for prisoners-of-war, served in hospitals, schools, to troops in WWI and WWII. It almost was rationed in WWII, with mothers told to spread it \"very thinly, for now.\"Traditionally, Marmite is served on sandwiches and especially on toast at breakfast on toast \"soldiers\" or triangles of toast that kids can dip into their boiled eggs. The flavor is meaty, salty, though it has less salt than the butter you might use with it, and it has no meat or animal product--it's made of yeast so is vegetarian-vegan.The flavor, frankly, takes some getting used to if you don't like strong, savory things. However, if you like savory, meaty flavors and want something non-sugary sweet on  your breakfast toast, Marmite is fantastic. The closest I can describe the flavor is on the order of soy sauce, beef bouillion or mushroom pate. Other uses for Marmite are to flavor soups, meat or vegetable loaves, and stews, as a mix in dips or on bread for sandwiches and canapes.4 grams or about 1\/8 ounce of Marmite has the following B vitamins:Riboflavin  0.28mg (17.5% RDA)Niacin  5.4mg (35.6% RDA)Folic Acid  100ug (50.0% RDA)Vitamin B12  0.5ug (60.0% RDA)","overall":5,"summary":"For those who like savory flavors, a real treat on toast","unixReviewTime":1097539200,"reviewTime":"10 12, 2004"}

I've been participating in an on-line, UK based think-tank dealing with international brands and digital advertising. As we discussed products that we grew up with and are still loyal to Marmite came up several times. I looked at some Marmite ads (the British call them \"adverts\"), and then searched for it on Amazon. Being a dedicated foodie I decided to give it a shot. Here is my impression:When I first opened the glass jar and gave it a whiff it seemed oddly familiar. I put just a dab on my spoon and tasted it straight. Again, strangely familiar. The taste was very strong, almost condensed. I could taste the beer-like yeast but I was also getting a savory, deep vegetable flavor. Then it hit me.I love to make sauces and I often use pre-made glaces and demi-glaces which have a very thick consistency when gently heated (before heating they are almost solid). They come in many different varieties: beef; duck; veal; chicken; lamb; seafood; mushroom; vegetable; etc. Marmite has a strong resemblance to a straight, undiluted, vegetable glace. Pungent, earthy and with that quality that the Japanese refer to as \"Umami\". WOW! Who knew? Well, I guess a lot of people did but it was new to me. Now, what to do with it...My on-line British friends gave me some sage advice: use it sparingly and on some sort of bread with butter. I bought some fresh English Muffin bread from a local artisan bakery shop, lightly toasted it, coated it thinly with about 2\/3 teaspoon of Marmite and spread some salted Vermont cultured butter onto it. HEAVEN! The Marmite balanced out the heaviness of the butter perfectly. That gave me the inspiration for my next test. I've alway loved a toasted bagel with cream cheese or Marscapone but need something to cut the palate-coating fat of the cheese besides a slice of onion (lox works well if you have it). Marmite fit the bill technically, but I think that I will have to get used to the combination. Still, I will keep using it here for a while and I think that it might become a favorite for me.Next I tried it in a simple sauce. I browned a tablespoon of finely chopped shallots in 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter (who am I kidding? I used 2 tablespoons of butter). After the shallots were browned I added 3 tablespoons of Marite and 1 teaspoon of water. I reduced it a little and added 1\/3 cup of heavy cream, a small bouquet garnet in cheesecloth and 1 tablespoon of dry sherry. I reduced it by about half and adjusted the strength by adding more Marmite (I needed more, maybe I should have used less cream). When finished it tasted really good, not great but it could certainly WOW most people. Put this on fish, chicken, turkey, or any light meat or veggie and it works.Marmite has an advertising campaign that tells people that they will either love it or hate it. I am definitely in the love camp.More Than Gourmet Classic Roastd Vegetable Demi-Glace, 1.5-Ounces (Pack of 6)More Than Gourmet Veggie-stock Gold; Vegetable Stock, 16-Ounce Packages","overall":5,"summary":"A Yankee's take on a British staple","unixReviewTime":1282003200,"reviewTime":"08 17, 2010"}

And when the sugar boils down into syrup, the flavor comes out.  So, okay -- it IS sugar.  Politically incorrect.  Empty calories.... I know, I know.  But whether you take your sugar \"naturally\" in fruit or honey or \"unnaturally\" in hiprocessed candies and sugar-coated cereals, the chemical is the same....And the thing is not to get too much. And if I'm going to have a certain amount ANYway, there are days when this is how I want to eat it.  Ly'les Golden Syrup is  a nice flavor alternative to honey, or maple syrup.  The texture is thick like honey, but the flavor is light.  It has much more \"depth\" and thickness than corn syrup.  If you like crisp, Belgian waffles, this is great on them --with or without pats of melted butter.  My grandma used to use this more than 50 years ago and I started loving it as a kid.  She put it in frostings and who knows what else.  But I just like it as it is... dip your fingers in and lick them off.  Ummmmmmmm....  So why can't you get this stuff in your local supermarket?  I can't find it anywhere.... It's because most people don't know about it.  And don't know to ask for it, or how or where to get it.  I've never seen an ad for this, and it isn't manufactured by one of the megafoodgiant monopolies in the U.S. , but it is worth having.  I just wish I didn't have to order it in sufficient quantities to justify the shipping charge.  Kind of silly to pay $7 to have a $4 item shipped.  So then you buy several... but who has room to store several?  And it takes a long time to go through one can of it.  LIke, a year.  So, if I get three cans, I have enough for three years.

I already drink iced tea a lot, so I wanted to see how I could use that to my advantage.  This was actually my third pu erh tea and was the better of three.  The bags were substantial and held together really well during brewing.  You might have read how many folks don't like the taste of puerh, that it tastes like dirt, well, ya, I can see that, but of the brands I've tried this one tasted a lot less like dirt. Honestly, I don't think pu erh tastes a whole lot more dirt like than cheap oolong.  Anyway.  So, for weight loss, well....  OK, the article I read says two cups with or just after each meal and a cup of green tea between meal.  I did not use this way, just can't fit that much in time wise what with brewing and all.  I made sun tea, 32 ounces of water in a glass bottle with three pu erh bags and one green chai (chai is my favorite tea of all time).  When done I'd put two packs of stevia in the raw in and I was good to go.  I'd have one cup with each meal when home.  I found that as long as I was not bad about my eating this regimen would result in a tiny bit of weight loss, a few pounds, but I just couldn't keep it going, eating out and stuff.  If I was bad with eating then drinking this tea  kept me from gaining.  I can only imagine if I really followed what the article said or if I could just keep drinking it three time every day then real weight loss could happen.  My current weight is quite troublesome as it is hormonal (perimenopause) and doesn't respond to much, even exercise.  To see what little I did see with this tea gives me hope.  I do plan to try hitting it again and try to stick with it regularly enough to affect my weight for real.  In summary, of the two pu erh teas I've tried this one was definitely better tasting and higher quality, so if you are shopping for which brand I do recommend this brand. If you are looking for a recommendation for weight loss, then I think I can say yes, pu erh can help you lose weight, but you have to drink enough of it regularly enough and paired with green tea to get it to work.  If you are looking for a healthy tea, then look no further, pu erh is higher in polyphenols than any other tea, and based on my latest cholesterol tests it really does help keep that down too.","overall":5,"summary":"Best taste of three brands I've tried, did help with weight and cholesterol too","unixReviewTime":1385596800,"reviewTime":"11 28, 2013"}

I have been looking for something clearer and cleaner than what has typically been available in the local grocery. After reading the description of Clear Jel I was tempted to forego this one. I am glad I didn't. This product is a modified corn-starch. What does 'modified' mean?? I don't know. And truth told, I don't really care too much. The real questions that need to be answered are, \"Does it do what it is supposed to do?\", \"Does it do it better than a different, readily available product?\" and \"Is it a cost-effective alternative?\" With those questions in mind, I made the purchase and have now done some testing.1) Yes, it most certainly does exactly what it is supposed to do. It thickens 'things' beautifully and without too much difficulty in use. 2) Whether it does it 'better' or not is a very subjective thing...although there are certainly some quantifiable differences between it and regular corn-starch. After using it for several fruit based liquids, I found the end results to be remarkably clear. Far clearer than any flour or corn-starch product that I have used in the past. Another real bonus, is its ability to maintain its thickening power after repeated heatings. This makes it ideal for canning purposes where the end product must be first cooked, then canned, then used at a later date. Some thickeners won't hold up to repeated heating very well. Another point to note is this product (Clear Jel) has been used for many years in commercial applications. That doesn't necessarily make it better, but it does indicate that it has been found to be remarkable consistent and repeatable. 3) Ah, the real question is about cost-effectiveness. Clear Jel is not inexpensive (at least in these quantities..). I would be very interested in knowing what the cost differences are to a commercial account. In any event, the cost-effectiveness question can only be answered by you. I find it to be okay....not spectacular mind you....but then again I don't use it every day. But, when I need something like this to make a thickened compote or a berry pie filling or......well, anything that I want to can or preserve and still be colorful and CLEAR (or anything that I want to reheat or do a secondary cook, then it is probably worth the cost...at least to me.An interesting side note...There is an INSTANT version of Clear Jel also available.Instant Clear Jel, 1 lb.I REALLY liked it.!! If you are only going to cook or heat your product ONE TIME or, alternatively, want to thicken something COLD (NO heating!!) the instant version is probably a better bet. (Just don't try to can anything with it...manufacturer says it is NOT designed to be re-heated..)So, I give four stars for Clear Jel because it is that good. Could easily be five stars if you don't necessarily worry too much about costs. Could also be three stars if cost weighs heavily on your purchase decision.","overall":4,"summary":"3 to 5 stars---depending on your reasoning..","unixReviewTime":1375228800,"reviewTime":"07 31, 2013"}

Shortly after sampling the gravy I had a severe toxic reaction; my face looked like a puffer fish, my heart was racing, vertigo, my tongue started to swell,  I developed sepsis and my lungs partially collapsed.The packaging does not provide any guidance or black box warning (as it should!) about the severe toxicity if used in quantities greater than .5% of total volume of food or liquid.  The manufacturer is negligent and even deceptive in marketing this manufactured product as if it were all natural.Xanthan gum is a largely indigestible polysaccharide that is produced by bacteria called Xanthomonas Camestris.  Manufacturers place the bacteria in a growth medium that contains sugars and other nutrients, and the resulting product of bacterial fermentation is purified, dried, powdered, and sold as xanthan gum. (Makes you wonder who first thought to put it in food, doesn't it?)In other words, xanthan gum is an industrial processed product--  It is a polysaccharide produced by a biotechnological fermentation process--a chemical. There is nothing natural about xanthan gum.Certainly never mix or serve to small children until the dangers are fully explained by the FDA's ongoing investigations. Currently, there are on-going lawsuits as a result of Xanthan Gum being added to baby formula to thicken it, the babies intestines developed holes and collapsed, resulting in deaths.FDA has issued new cautions and studies as to this food additive's safety. It certainly should not be sold in bulk giving the appearance that it is a flour of some type very misleading and possibly deadly.  We'll likely all hear more soon on this issue - just be cautious and know what and how much you are putting into your food and body - or your family's.One lesser-known use of xanthan gum is in the oil industry. As a thickener, it can be added to drilling fluid or drilling mud to improve its function. Drilling fluid serves several purposes, including cooling the drill bit, providing hydrostatic pressure, and helping to lift solids out of the borehole and keeping those solids in suspension when drilling stops.Gluten-free is not the same food just without Gluten, something else is added in it's place.  FInd out what and how safe it it is - better yet, just avoid any foods with Gluten if you do have Celiac's disease.

My faves were chocolate and banana.  When I became an adult, it occurred to me that you could hardly find a real malted any longer--only &#34;shakes&#34;.  Also, as an adult, I begin to bake my own bread and discovered, through reading a lot of information about bread-baking, that &#34;barley malt&#34; was an ingredient that artisan bakers used in their loaves.  At first I purchased the liquid form of barley malt and didn't even connect the fact that this was real &#34;malt&#34;, only in liquid form.  I added it to some of my bread recipes and the result was a positive one, in yielding  richer tasting breads.  But the problem with the liquid is that you refrigerate it, and subsequently, it is a sticky, syrupy substance--difficult to measure out.  Hence, my interest in the powder form of malt.  This product is the real thing.  It has NO ADDED SUGAR, like most other products do.  Other recognizable-named products work well, if you just want a &#34;drink powder&#34;, but if you want the most nutritious substance, able to enhance your yeast baking, AND to make divine malteds and ice cream sundaes, GET THIS PRODUCT.

Shelnutt \"Mystery Novelist\"","helpful":[29,39],"reviewText":"Even though I write reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels, I was sparked by Amazon's enthusiasm, to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here.  My first purchase (of products beyond books) included a grain called QUINOA (Keenwa.The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing.In that maiden purchase I also added lavender and clove essential oils to my shopping cart, along with powdered cloves, and lavender tea.  See my Listmania on Essential Oils (which indicates which items I've reviewed) for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves, available from various vendors here.I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet, a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor (and culinary versatility), in addition to being baseline healthy with full-spectrum nourishment.If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups (in addition to water, of course) to eat or drink, those would be Quinoa, Coffee, Dairy Products, and a variety of greens, spices, & nuts.  Yeah, okay, dairy products; and greens, spices, & nuts may be considered more than 2 items, but, for me they're two categories.I'm not a vegetarian because I love meat, chicken, and fish, but if I'm working with limitations, I'm making do with the most basic of basics, while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor (yeah, yeah, and nutrition, too, though according to my beliefs, \"nutrition\" dims and deteriorates, unless it's in the living presence of \"yummy.\").Quinoa, I believe, would take care of all (or at least many) basic nutritional needs.The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal, and then to \"gourmet it\" accordingly.-- As \"rice\" I add savory herbs like parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic, onions, etc.  Actually, most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa.  Think of what Lidia's Italian Table does with \"noodle heaven\"; then substitute Quinoa for pasta (I like pasta too, of course).-- As \"oatmeal\" I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit (including raisin and date types), brown sugar, molasses, maple, creme, that type of thing.As far as cooking instructions, to me they're basically the same as rice:- Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio.  2 cups liquid ( water, broth, vegetable, or fruit juices) to 1 cup Quinoa.-- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa, covering the pot, and simmering for 12-15 minutes.-- I've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave.  You can heat the water to boil in a bowl then add Quinoa, cover, and cook.  Normally, a microwave cooks 4 times faster than \"outside-the-waves\" cooking, but, of course that time varies with larger amounts of food.  For example, 1 potato cooks (on average) in 4 - 8 minutes, 2 potatoes require double that, or 8 -16 minutes.-- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave, I might use 1\/4 cup Quinoa with 2\/4 () cup liquid.I have actually simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts (Quinoa and water in a bowl) in the microwave, and cooking it on high, maybe 3 minutes, till the liquid bubbles.  Then I cover the bowl with a plate \"lid\"; zap it for another minute or half, then let it \"steep\" in the microwave, without opening it, for another few minutes.  (Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ, you'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you, or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag.)In the microwave, Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice.But, I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method.  I don't use minute rice, since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly, and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate \"lid\" I can just place it on the table for family style \"digging in.\"I love the nutty, barley flavor of Quinoa.  Thankfully, so does my husband!In the past I've purchased Quinoa from Bob's Red Mill and White Mountain Farms in Colorado, in the San Juan mountain area (have always been satisfied with those sellers, when\/if the products are available on Amazon).  Having used many different Now Foods products, I'm very confident in ordering any item from them.  And now Berry Farms has been added to my list of healthful, gourmet goods.Quinoa has an iteresting history, including the development of a saponin coating on the grain:--  The genetics in the Quinoa seeds, after eons and ages of growing, had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varment's, like worms or parasites.-- Knowing what saponin is and does, I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants, or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects.-- Once the saponin is removed, I'm not sure how long the \"naked\" grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions.  Certainly, Quinoa (being a very strong, wise-old-grain with high integrity, for many reasons) would be able to do so longer than other similar, eons-younger food offerings.  I'm not concerned about this, and will usually order either pre-washed grain or saponin coated, whichever is readily available.Quinoa grows only above a 7,000-foot-elevation and requires a certain growing climate, which can be found only in certain areas of the world.  Some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas, not tested until fairly recently (in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas).Interesting stories about Quinoa's long history are bountiful, but I won't get into those.  A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it, and of course, many are offered here on Amazon.I remain ever thankful for magical foods (which are both gourmet and healthy in quality), especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life, magic, wholeness, and flavor out of most everything.  For the sake of \"health\"?Here's an interesting question to ponder:Why and how, for a while (eons), did we lose Quinoa seeds, which had \"lived\" long enough to develop saponin.  Why and how did we find them again?For an easy, exotic recipe using Quinoa, see my review ofVirgin Coconut Oil (Certified Organic) 12 fl.ozLinda ShelnuttAuthor of several books, including:Molasses Moon","overall":5,"summary":"High Mountain Magic.

It doesn't have as much flavor as regular popcorn and is definitely not what I would call &#34;sweet&#34; like a kettle corn, but it isn't bitter either. It does taste very similar to popcorn.As other reviewers wrote, the key is using high heat oil (Canola, Safflower, Peanut, etc - not olive or &#34;vegetable&#34; oil). I used stove top popping in metal revere pan with lid and canola oil. Pop it in small batches or risk burning it. Use about teaspoon of high temp, high quality oil  and no more than a quarter cup of sorghum berries at a time. I popped it in a tall 3 qt revere saucepan with lid, but I suspect any of the churn style stove top poppers would be much better - it will make a mess without a lid. Once oil was hot I tested a couple sourghum berries and when they popped I added the quarter cup, placed lid on and slid the pan on my stovetop until many had popped. not all kernels will pop, but the unpopped will be tasty and will be as hard as unpopped popcorn.If you are not allergic to corn, stick with regular popcorn unless you just want to give this a try.","overall":4,"summary":"looks like quarter size \"popcorn\" when popped","unixReviewTime":1379548800,"reviewTime":"09 19, 2013"}

If you're going to eat them right out of the bag, be prepared for pieces on your clothes and carpet.  You can't leave them there because of the very high fat content.  They can cause oil stains.  I find it helpful to have my dog around when I'm snacking on these chips.I didn't realize that the fat content of coconut was so super-high.  Two ounces, or approximately one loose cup, contains 454 calories, of which 378 are fat.  There are 42 grams of fat in a 2 oz serving, of which 35.9 grams are saturated fat.  I know that there are health benefits to including coconut oil in my diet, but I thnk I'll be using these chips as more of a condiment, like with fruit and yogurt.Coconut is a natural anti-fungal.

The clump dissolved fairly readily, especially as the materials began to heat. But when done it needed no added salt.

They used a differentbrand, and a beef base had given a certain dish a flavor I'd had in restaurants that was missing in home cooking.One thing to note - while these bases all say \"no added MSG\" it does NOT mean they are MSG-free!It means they didn't ADD any straight MSG.  They still have hydrolyzed items in them, which are a form of MSG.If you are sensitive to it or allergic to MSG, then heads-up, you might be careful about base products.That being said...I'd never personally used it before, so was not really familiar with it. I had a great soup recipe that I wantedto try, but it called for vegetable stock. There was not a drop of stock in the house of ANY kind, so I thoughtabout my new ham base. I stirred several spoonfuls up in a separate bowl with very hot water, but I probably didn'thave to do it that way. I then added it to my soup, which had lentils, sweet potatoes, apples, regular potatoes, onionsand carrots. I figured ham would work with any of those items individually, so should be okay together.Wow!  The soup was SO GOOD! The ham base gave it a nice, smokey flavor. You'd have thought I put a ham bone with meatin there with the other ingredients!The base does have to be refrigerated once it is opened.

That is important to me.  The base is very easy to spoon out; it doesn't harden in the cold of the frig.The bases are rich in flavor, have a slightly sweet taste, and contain less salt than most bouillon cubes.  This mushroom base is no exception:  It has a deep, complex and authentic mushroom flavor.I keep several of the flavors in my frig at one time:  The jars are short and compact and I can stack them if I keep them out of high traffic areas.

Better Than Bouillon (BTB) is one of my go-to ingredients for adding flavor to vegetable soup and stock, and also less expected dishes like pasta, or braised veggies and even stir-fry sauces.  Though shelf-stable when you buy it, the BTB needs to be refrigerated once open.  I keep mine in the door of the fridge for easy access, and can fit three or four varieties of BTB in the shelf where eggs are meant to be stored.  Though it takes up space in the fridge, it gives me lots more room in my pantry and freezer, since I'm no longer storing boxes, cans or jars of broth.I also like the flexibility to use the amount I need for a specific recipe.  I wouldn't always open a huge box of broth if I only wanted a splash of it to loosen a stew, for example, but I can easily use a 1\/2 tsp of BTB in water and dilute my gravies without diluting their flavor as well.  You'd be surprised how many places you can ramp up flavor with this product.  I often use it in place of salt as well, particularly in saucy dishes where it blends easily.  The sodium content is comparable to other bouillon I've seen, but the flavor seems richer, so less is required overall.I'm not a nutritionist but I feel like I should comment on the reviews which blast BTB for adding MSG; as far as I can tell from my research, they don't add MSG.  Now, not *adding* MSG is not the same as not *having* any MSG, which is I think what confuses and frustrates some people.  MSG is a naturally occurring compound in some foods, but can also be isolated and added into foods where it doesn't naturally occur.  BTB *does* contain ingredients that have natural MSG in them, therefore it has some natural MSG as well, but is stating the truth when they say they don't use MSG as an additive.For what it's worth, completely avoiding MSG in a typical American diet can be quite a challenge.  I've gotten really horrid migraines for a long time and spent years cutting out all kinds of different foods, including MSG, to try to decrease the frequency of my headaches.  For me, MSG can make pain worse, but doesn't cause it to occur altogether.  My husband, being a thoughtful man, has made soups for me using BTB when I've been knocked out due to a migraine, and with the quantities we use in our cooking, I haven't had any problems.  Of course, your experience may differ.Overall, I highly recommend Better Than Bouillon's Vegetable Base.  It's an excellent way to add flavor to dishes, easy to use and undeniably better for you than most traditional bouillon cubes.","overall":5,"summary":"Excellent Bouillon for Vegetable Dishes","unixReviewTime":1298592000,"reviewTime":"02 25, 2011"}

I figured it said, \"USDA Organic\". Well someone is not doing the right thing cause yeast extract is on the label and it admits it is not organic, but the front is miss leading! They will not refund your money only sent you more product.  This is their email to me in regards:Good afternoon Danielle.Thank you for your email.  MSG was first produced from a seaweed broth in 1908, and today disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate can both be produced from fish or dried seaweed &#8211; although typical production of these ingredients now uses different raw materials. These flavor enhancers often work in conjunction with MSG to create a more complete flavor profile.It is important for you to know that our product does contain some MSG.  Although we do not add any MSG to our Better that Bouillon line of products, they naturally contain MSG from the ingredients we use.  MSG comes from the common amino acid glutamic acid, and glutamic acid is naturally present in our bodies, as well as in many foods and food additives.  Since glutamic acid is naturally occurring in all protein, I am not aware of a chicken broth or base that does not contain at least some natural MSG.  Of course, as you can see on our label, we do not add any additional MSG to our products.MSG has been a hot topic in the food industry for years.  Because it is a high profile ingredient, MSG has been studied extensively by the FDA as well as independent researchers.  In fact, the FDA commissioned a study on MSG in the 1995 to specifically answer the question whether MSG was safe as a food ingredient.  The study came to the conclusion that MSG was safe.  Results of this study can be found on the FDA website.[...]The term \"natural flavor,\" \"natural flavoring,\" \"flavor\" or \"flavoring\" means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product or roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or any other edible portion of a plant, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose primary function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in 21 CFR 182.10, 182.20, 182.40, 182.50 and 184, and the substances listed in 21 CFR 172.510. The term natural flavor, natural flavoring, flavor or flavoring may also be used to designate spices, powered onion, powdered garlic, and powdered celery.We appreciate and value your business.Kedra AndersonCustomer Service Coordinator|Customer Service DepartmentSoutheastern Mills, IncPhone 706-378-6561800-334-4468 ext 6561Fax  706-378-6578Email  kanderson@semills.comHigh Performance Work Placecid:image003.png@01CEEB65.908BAC20","overall":1,"summary":"NOT ORGANIC!!!

I at one point emailed Barry farms concerning something about it, and they told me it they buy 50 lb bags of the stuff from Kraft and break it down into 1 lb bags. All the same, its cheaper than buying the little round canisters of cheese powder that kraft sells for popcorn.To compare to the stuff in the blue box mac and cheese, so I suggest 1\/4 cup of cheese powder to 1\/2 cup of pasta (uncooked) -- but you can experiment for yourself.In terms of making mac and cheese, I suggest mixing it up with a little oil and milk (as suggested on the Kraft Mac & cheese boxes) and making sure the sauce is smooth BEFORE putting it on the cooked pasta or it will clump. The stuff for the blue box contains something to make it mix in smooth that the stuff for the popcorn doesn't have, so you do need to work a little to make sure the texture is smooth.It is kind of sad that the shipping for this is so expensive (over twice the price of the item itself) but thats more about the post office than the company that sells it.

Whey is a by-product of milk (remember that little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet eating her curds and whey).  Whey has a somewhat acidic taste that is rather crude.  Cheddar cheese is way down the line in terms of percentage quantity in this stuff.  I couldn't think of what this stuff tasted like until I read the other review.  It's taste does not resemble that of cheddar cheese.  I knew the product had an odd taste which I did not care for.  I just didn't realize what that taste was until I came across the other review.  There are no ingredients listed on the label.  Now I understand why most liked the product.  I assume because they are used to the taste of boxed macaroni and cheese products available in the grocery store with the orange\/yellow powder in the packet inside the box.  And most have come to think of that taste as cheese.  Finer tastes however will reject this stuff, I think because it has little cheese.  Cheddar cheese is made with the by products of milk as well.  The big difference is the cultures that are added to produce the various types of cheese.  Plus the aging.  Whey requires no aging or cultures.  Another of the characteristics of whey is that it has little orange\/yellow color.  This stuff has food colorings added to produce the appearance you see in the bag.  I read another review where the writer complained about the lack of labeling.  I agree because it is important to most to know what they are consuming.  If you look at the ingredients of some of the other cheese powders you will see cheddar as the first ingredient unlike this stuff.  I believe the reason that this product has no ingredient labeling is to hide that fact.  By regulation ingredients are to be listed in the order of the percentage contained therein.  In other words the first ingredient would be the highest percentage and therefore the last ingredient would be the lowest quantity contained.  I'm not sure what the percentage of cheddar cheese is in this stuff but its way down the line and not the first.  I have tasted other cheese powders with ingredient lists.  Some of best are those with cheese as the first listed ingredient not the 3rd or 4th.  I really don't like the taste of whey powder.  It is crude and acidic.  And that is to me what this stuff tastes like.  I doubt whether I'll buy any more of this.  To each his own taste, though.  I don't purport to know what anyone else prefers.","overall":1,"summary":"ARTIFICIAL TASTING STUFF","unixReviewTime":1318464000,"reviewTime":"10 13, 2011"}

Here you can see the ingredients, the nutritional content PLUS the directions for making a simple sauce.The PRODUCER of the product is clear that it is a whey based powder made with shelf life and stability products, not unlike the bright yellow cheese that most kids are clamoring for on their commercial  mac n' cheese.In other words if you are trying to make a mac n' cheese with a familiar tasting cheesy sauce (yes, I'm looking at you Kraft!) but want to use your own noodles, this is a fantastic product.  Definitely passed the offspring taste test even with gluten-free corn+quinoa elbow noodles.  My kids thought this was great, and as a rare treat I am fine with the ingredients.If you want a yummy popcorn treat, this will work too.If you are looking for maximal healthiness, then do not buy this and make a real cheese sauce.  Those are great too :)Most importantly, do not be fooled by any particular vendor, which can change day to day.  Examine the description closely (and perhaps double check the manufacturer's own site for details), and check the shipping fees.  If it's an Amazon-sold product then super saver\/prime shipping apply.  If it's a partner-vendor who stores it's inventory in an Amazon warehouse, then the same applies regarding shipping (and can be factored into costs).  If it's a partner-vendor who does not do that, well, then you must double check the shipping prices as occasionally there are some 'interesting' shipping fees to be found out there.Also, for a partner-vendor, do your due diligence regarding vendor feedback and decide if that is someone you want to do business with.I happened to have a happy experience with this product.  The price was higher than the producer, but given the shipping etc it was all even.  No problem for me.  The taste was fine for what I was looking for (again, I'm looking at you Kraft!), and the ingredients are fine on an occasional basis for my family.  Your family and taste goals may differ of course.My only quibbles are with the vendor and how the product was described\/labeled and that will be feedback left for them, not here on the actual product review.My 1 star off IS for the producer, as I think the directions for a sauce should have been on THEIR labeling which IS part of the product.Recommended, but read the descriptions and check the vendor out!JTG","overall":4,"summary":"The issues I have with this product are primarily due to the vendor, not the product...","unixReviewTime":1353801600,"reviewTime":"11 25, 2012"}

Both are very similar with a very slight nod to Hoosier Hill Farm's for better flavor (IMHO).  The products do not have a strong &#8220;cheesy&#8221; and are a little more salty than I would like, however it is powder cheese after all.  I tried both water and milk in the preparation, and not surprisingly, milk yields a more favorable result.  As a standalone cheese sauce it OK but not great, however I find it works well as a flavored binder or thickening agent with marinara or spaghetti sauce.  The long shelf life (if stored correctly) makes it a nice product to have around, I&#8217;ll buy more.Preparation:  Like most powdered food stuff, mixing the product takes a little care to avoid a lumpy result.  Its best to the powder in a small cup, add a little HOT liquid, and fold together with a spoon to form a thick paste.  Continue adding small amounts of liquid at a time until the past becomes a thick liquid consistency, and then the remaining liquid can be added.","overall":4,"summary":"Not bad for powdered cheese","unixReviewTime":1361577600,"reviewTime":"02 23, 2013"}

They make just about any food, veggie, dairy product, or spice in either a freeze dried or powdered form.  As an outdoor enthusiast that enjoys carrying along a little taste of home into the savage wilderness, this is a company that I am well familiar with.  Not everything they make is delicious, or worth it. My experience with them however is that most of their products are just about the finest, and many times the only ones around.  This cheddar cheese powder is definitely one of their best.  Many reviewers here mention making macaroni and cheese, and popcorn with it.  Although I have used it for those purposes like everyone else, I have also used this powder as an addition to many soups that call for cheese, or grated cheese. (It makes a very flavorful substitute for grated cheese in many recipes.) Hamburger and sausage soups are a good example.  Many times I have concocted delicious one pot meals using this powder while out in the wilds on a hike, or camping. They are remembered as some of the best meals I have ever had. It is also very good when sprinkled on home made pizza, and I have an excellent recipe that includes this powder, butter, flour, and salt, that makes a delicious cheese spread for crackers and super bowl parties. Barry Farms cheddar powder is strong and flavorful, and a little goes a long ways.  A one pound bag will get you through many a recipe and outdoor adventure.  However since the shipping on this is a little high, (and the powder so reasonable) I suggest buying two pounds or more at once and storing it in a good air tight container.  You will save a lot on the shipping, and this powder will last for months if stored correctly.  I highly recommend this cheddar powder for those that enjoy the simple pleasures of popcorn and mac and cheese, as well as the more adventurous among us in the kitchen, and over an open fire...","overall":5,"summary":"Excellent, With A Variety Of Uses..","unixReviewTime":1256083200,"reviewTime":"10 21, 2009"}

The liquid is best for cooking and for adding to cold beverages. The dropper helps to measure it accurately. The price through Amazon is better than that at the grocery store. I will keep buying it as long as Amazon has it available. The words &#34;Limited Quantities&#34; in the product listing make me wonder if it will continue to be available at Amazon.com.","overall":5,"summary":"Excellent product at good price","unixReviewTime":1368057600,"reviewTime":"05 9, 2013"}

There is no weird aftertaste like with other artificial sweeteners, and a 4 oz bottle lasts me for a decent amount of time so the cost is equivalent.

Unless you use too much, there is no bitterness. So go easy. I use 6 tiny drops to a cup of coffee. Our iced tea actually tastes better with liquid stevia than it does with sugar. Surprising! Now I use it in a lot of cooking. When baking, use applesauce to replace the bulk of sugar (experiment with it) and then add stevia (we use one teaspoonful of clear liquid stevia for one cup of sugar). I will not use artificial sweeteners because they are not safe. It was a happy day when I discovered stevia.","overall":5,"summary":"I'm telling everybody about stevia clear liquid","unixReviewTime":1370995200,"reviewTime":"06 12, 2013"}
